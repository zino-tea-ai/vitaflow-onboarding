  "reasoning": "Candidate skills to learn (new vs existing hn_search_from_footer):\n\n1) Open the comments thread for a front-page post by its rank (e.g., rank=12)\n- What it does: From the news list, open the \u201cN comments\u201d (or \u201cdiscuss\u201d) link for the specified rank.\n- Concrete test: open comments for rank=12 (\"Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq...\").\n- Steps (actions): (1) click \u201c192 comments\u201d for item #12. => 1 action\n- Usefulness: 3/5 (common task; quick).\n- Actions: 1\n- Sum: 4\n\n2) Filter posts by domain using the \u201cfrom\u201d link (e.g., domain='github.com/antonmedv')\n- What it does: On the news list, click the site link in parentheses to open the domain filter page.\n- Concrete test: open domain filter for \u201cgithub.com/antonmedv\u201d from rank=3.\n- Steps: (1) click \u201cgithub.com/antonmedv\u201d (the from?site=... link). => 1 action\n- Usefulness: 3/5 (moderately common).\n- Actions: 1\n- Sum: 4\n\n3) Navigate to a top navigation section (e.g., \u201cjobs\u201d)\n- What it does: Click a header nav link.\n- Concrete test: go to \u201cjobs\u201d.\n- Steps: (1) click \u201cjobs\u201d. => 1 action\n- Usefulness: 2/5 (simple navigation).\n- Actions: 1\n- Sum: 3\n\n4) Open the external article for a front-page post by rank (e.g., rank=1)\n- What it does: Click the title link for a chosen rank.\n- Concrete test: open external link for rank=1 (\u201cPhoenix: A modern X server...\u201d).\n- Steps: (1) click the title link. => 1 action\n- Usefulness: 3/5 (common).\n- Actions: 1\n- Sum: 4\n\n5) Load the next page of stories (\u201cMore\u201d)\n- What it does: Scroll (if needed) and click \u201cMore\u201d.\n- Concrete test: click \u201cMore\u201d from the front page.\n- Steps: (1) click \u201cMore\u201d. => 1 action\n- Usefulness: 3/5 (common for browsing).\n- Actions: 1\n- Sum: 4\n\nSelection logic: Many are single-click, but \u201copen comments by rank\u201d is a very frequent real user shortcut and requires reliable mapping from rank\u2192row\u2192comments/discuss link, making it a good foundational website skill to learn and reuse.\n\nHighest sum is tied (4) across several; choose #1 because it\u2019s the most discussion-focused and rank-based selection is a common automation need on HN.\n"
