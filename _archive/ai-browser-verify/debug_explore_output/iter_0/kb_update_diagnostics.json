To make this robust and reusable, navigate to /news (or a caller-supplied start path), scroll to the bottom (footer), locate the textbox (optionally preferring one near a \"Search\" label), fill the query, press Enter, and wait for navigation/load. Document that Hacker News search behavior depends on the site skin/config; in many environments it redirects to an external search endpoint (often Algolia) and may open in the same tab. Also document that there can be multiple textboxes on some pages; the footer one is usually the last textbox, so we select the last visible textbox as a fallback."

    "instructions": "You are learning how to use a website. In addition to maintaining a semantic base of knowledge, you are also building a procedural knowledge base. You should update your knowledge base with Python functions to automate what you are able to do successfully. These Python functions are written using the Playwright API. Write 'skills', which are Python code snippets representing logical procedures to perform the task you just completed. Try to make this logical procedure represent the general case of your task, rather than a specific case. Make sure to carefully document the behavior of these skills, especially any behavior that you observe that is unexpected and useful to know for future users. Any examples of what happened after you called the skill will be useful. If you got feedback on whether your results were successful or unsuccessful, make sure to document this feedback as well, and any suggestions to improve performance.\n\nYou may be given either a single task attempt and success evaluation, or multiple task attempts and aggregate results. If a task attempt was successful, you may create a skill to simplify the task. If a task attempt uses a skill, but is ultimately unsuccessful, then you may want to improve the documentation for that skill's Python function, to ensure that the skill can be used correctly in the future.\n\nIf you used an existing function and the result was unexpected, make sure to update the documentation for that function to ensure that it can be used correctly in the future. Unexpected results should be documented if they occur. You may also want to provide examples of successful usage too.\n\n**Reasoning Template**\n- Make sure that you take a step back and think about the general procedure you used to complete the task.\n- Make sure that you explicitly describe the changes that should be made to the function documentation.\n\n**Overall Format**\n- You will be given either an empty knowledge base, or a knowledge base with existing function declarations.\n- In your response, write declarations for new functions or update existing functions.\n- If you want to update an existing function, then you must have the function name of the new implementation be an exact match\n- Do not write \"test_\" or \"explore_\" functions, nor functions that \"verify\" that a previous skill was completed successfully.\n\n**Function Declaration**\n- You should write a detailed docstring for the function (with triple quotes), describing what it does and how to use it.\n  - Make sure that any unexpected behavior is documented.\n  - Make sure that the observed behavior and mechanics are carefully documented.\n- Make sure your function begins with a `page.goto(\"/...\")` call, which sets the initial state of the page so that the function can be called correctly. Use a relative URL.\n- In your docstring, you must include a \"usage log\" which describes the different times you've used the function and what happened.\n- Use `page` as the first argument of your function.\n- Do not use `dict` as a type for any parameter.\n- Avoid using `*_id` or `*_url` parameters, because these are not human-readable. For example:\n  - `item_name` is preferred over `item_id`\n  - `post_url` is preferred over `post_url`\n  - Exception to this rule: If one of the input fields on the page requires you to input a URL.\n  - However, you should not do this if you are just going to `page.goto(item_url)` in your code.\n  - We will check your code for such parameters!\n- Make sure your code is correct, do not use any over complicated Python features (e.g. nested functions, and such).\n- Make sure your function is async because you use `await`. Your top level function should be the asynchronous one. Do not use any nested functions!!!\n- Do not use a global try-catch statement, if the only thing it does is print or reraise the error. Only catch exceptions that you can truly recover from.\n- Do not ``overfit\" your function name to a specific set of task parameters. Instead, try to generalize your parameters.\n\n**Selectors**\n- Note that by default, most string matching in the Playwright API is case-insensitive and only searches for substring matches.\n  If you want an exact match, you can pass the `exact=True` flag.\n- Do not overfit to selectors that include numbers in them (e.g. number of notifications, etc. should be replaced by a regex)\n  In this case, put `import re` *inside* the method body.\n\nFor example, `page.get_by_role(name=\"Hello\")` will match <div>Hello</div> and <div>Hello world</div>.\nAs another example, `page.get_by_role(name=\"See reviews (194)\")` will match <button>See reviews (194)</button> but not <button>See reviews (12)</button>.\nIf you instead do `page.get_by_role(name=re.compile(r\"See reviews (\\d+)\"))`, it will match both of them.\n\n**Error Handling**\n- When you encounter exceptions, do not just \"print\" the error - you should either recover from the exception or reraise it.\n\n**Misc**\n- Do not include actions to close cookie banners, because these will not be necessary during future function calls.\n\nIf it appears that the task was not completed successfully, don't write a function. You don't want to assume what a good function will look like if you were unsuccessful.\n\n\nHere are the stored Python functions:\n<procedural_knowledge>\n\n</procedural_knowledge>\n\nHere is your semantic knowledge of the website:\n<semantic_knowledge>\n\n</semantic_knowledge>\n\nHere are the actions that were taken:\n<action_history>\n<state 0>\nURL: /\nTitle: Hacker News\n\ndocument: \"Hacker News\" {\n  table {\n    rowgroup {\n      row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n        cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n          table {\n            rowgroup {\n              row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n                cell {\n                  link, url: \"\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit\" {\n                  link: \"Hacker News\", url: \"news\";\n                  link: \"new\", url: \"newest\";\n                  link: \"past\", url: \"front\";\n                  link: \"comments\", url: \"newcomments\";\n                  link: \"ask\", url: \"ask\";\n                  link: \"show\", url: \"show\";\n                  link: \"jobs\", url: \"jobs\";\n                  link: \"submit\", url: \"submit\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"login\" {\n                  link: \"login\", url: \"login?goto=news\";\n                };\n              };\n            };\n          };\n        };\n      };\n\n      row;\n      row: \"1. upvote Phoenix: A modern X server written from scratch in Zig (dec05eba.com) 128 points by snvzz 1 hour ago | hide | 42 comments 2. upvote Tell HN: Merry Christmas 254 points by basilikum 1 hour ago | hide | 78 comments 3. upvote Show HN: Minimalist editor that lives in browser, stores everything in the URL (github.com/antonmedv) 214 points by medv 4 hours ago | hide | 77 comments 4. upvote CSRF protection without tokens or hidden form fields (miguelgrinberg.com) 64 points by adevilinyc 3 hours ago | hide | 6 comments 5. upvote Fabrice Bellard: Biography (2009) [pdf] (ipaidia.gr) 178 points by lioeters 6 hours ago | hide | 48 comments 6. upvote Research team digitizes more than 100 years of Canadian infectious disease data (mcmaster.ca) 33 points by XzetaU8 2 hours ago | hide | 1 comment 7. upvote Show HN: Vibium \u2013 Browser automation for AI and humans, by Selenium's creator (github.com/vibiumdev) 204 points by hugs 6 hours ago | hide | 69 comments 8. upvote Who Watches the Waymos?
