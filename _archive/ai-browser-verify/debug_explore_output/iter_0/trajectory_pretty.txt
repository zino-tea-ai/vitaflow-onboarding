Plan: (1) Scroll to the page footer where the HN search box lives. (2) Locate the Search textbox in the footer, fill it with the query "zig x server". (3) Submit the search form (press Enter) and wait for navigation to the search results page. No knowledge_base helper functions are available.
</reasoning>

<code>
import asyncio

async def act(page):
    # Ensure we're at the footer where the search input is located
    await page.evaluate("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)")

    # Hacker News footer search: label text is typically "Search:" next to a textbox
    search_box = page.get_by_role("textbox")
    await search_box.wait_for(state="visible")
    await search_box.fill("zig x server")

    # Submit the search (HN search box submits on Enter)
    await search_box.press("Enter")
    await page.wait_for_load_state("domcontentloaded")
