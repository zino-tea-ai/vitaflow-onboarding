  "reasoning": "Proposed useful skills (shortcuts) for this Reddit page (no login/account actions):\n\n1) Skill: Search Reddit with optional filters (sort + scope)\n- What it does: Runs a search query from the top search box and (if available) sets filters like sort (Relevance/New/Top) and scope (Everywhere/This subreddit).\n- Usefulness (1-5): 5 (high-frequency, multi-step, core discovery workflow)\n- Expected actions:\n  1. Click search input (\u201cFind anything\u201d)\n  2. Type query\n  3. Press Enter\n  4. Click sort dropdown (e.g., \u201cBest\u201d/\u201cRelevance\u201d depending on context)\n  5. Click desired sort option\n  6. Click scope dropdown (e.g., \u201cEverywhere\u201d)\n  7. Click desired scope\n  => Total actions: 7\n- Sum rating: 5 + 7 = 12\n\n2) Skill: Open a trending search tile by keyword match\n- What it does: From the trending links near the top of the document, opens the one whose label contains a keyword (e.g., \u201cUkraine AND peace\u201d).\n- Usefulness: 3 (somewhat common; helps jump to trending topics)\n- Expected actions:\n  1. Scan & click matching trending link\n  => Total actions: 1\n- Sum rating: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3) Skill: Navigate to a popular community from the \u201cPopular Communities\u201d panel\n- What it does: Clicks a chosen community link (e.g., r/AskMen) and lands on that subreddit.\n- Usefulness: 3 (moderately common; mostly navigation)\n- Expected actions:\n  1. Click the chosen community link\n  => Total actions: 1\n- Sum rating: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n4) Skill: Open the comments page for the first feed post whose title matches text\n- What it does: Finds a feed post by (partial) title and opens it.\n- Usefulness: 4 (common; reduces scrolling + targeting)\n- Expected actions:\n  1. (Optional) Scroll until post appears\n  2. Click the post title\n  => Total actions: 2\n- Sum rating: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n5) Skill: Share a post by title (open share menu and copy link, if available)\n- What it does: Locates a post by title, clicks \u201cShare\u201d, then chooses \u201cCopy link\u201d (or equivalent).\n- Usefulness: 4 (common multi-step action)\n- Expected actions:\n  1. (Optional) Scroll to the post\n  2. Click \u201cShare\u201d\n  3. Click \u201cCopy link\u201d (or similar)\n  => Total actions: 3\n- Sum rating: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nHighest total: Skill #1 (12)\n\nNotes for automation feasibility from the AX tree: there\u2019s a global search field (\u201cFind anything\u201d) and visible filter controls like \u201cBest\u201d and \u201cEverywhere\u201d in the feed UI, which makes the \u201csearch with filters\u201d shortcut a good new skill to learn and automate.\n"
