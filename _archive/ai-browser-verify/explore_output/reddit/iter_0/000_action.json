  "prompt": "You generate Playwright code to interact with websites.\n - If you want to click a generic button (e.g. that belongs to an element), use the full `.get_by_role()` path to\n   the element (e.g. .get_by_role(\"group\", name=\"Test Item\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\")\n   instead of .get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\"), as this is ambiguous)\n - Write exceptionally *correct* Python code.\n - You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge_base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Search Reddit for keywords and restrict to a specific subreddit.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Reddit - The heart of the internet', with the url 'https://www.reddit.com/'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. Because you are on the first step, please use your existing knowledge of the website to create an overall plan for how to achieve the task.\nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"Reddit - The heart of the internet\" {\n  link: \"Home\", url: \"/\";\n  button: \"Get App\";\n  link: \"Log In\", url: \"/login/\";\n  button: \"Expand user menu\", expanded: False;\n  link: \"r/worldnews - Zelensky Proposes Demilitarized Zone in Eastern Ukraine as Way to Peace Zelenskyy reveals peace plan Zelensky Proposes Demilitarized Zone in Eastern Ukraine as Way to Peace r/worldnews icon r/worldnews and more\", url: \"/search/?q=Ukraine+AND+peace&source=trending\";\n  link: \"r/popculturechat - Trump Calls Stephen Colbert a 'Dead Man Walking' and Urges CBS to 'Put Him to Sleep' Trump comments on Colbert Trump Calls Stephen Colbert a 'Dead Man Walking' and Urges CBS to 'Put Him to Sleep' r/popculturechat icon r/popculturechat and more\", url: \"/search/?q=Trump+AND+Colbert&source=trending\";\n  link: \"r/television - 'The Middle' Actor Pat Finn Dead at 60 After Cancer Battle Actor Pat Finn dies at 60 'The Middle' Actor Pat Finn Dead at 60 After Cancer Battle r/television icon r/television and more\", url: \"/search/?source=trending\";\n  link: \"r/law - DOJ says it has found over a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein Epstein files latest DOJ says it has found over a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein r/law icon r/law and more\", url: \"/search/?q=%28Epstein+OR+%22Epstein+files%22%29+AND+%28DOJ+OR+%22Justice+Department%22%29+AND+%28release+OR+redaction+OR+volunteer%29&source=trending\";\n  main {\n    article: \"I stopped masking at home and my partner says I'm becoming \\\"impossible\\\"\" {\n      link: \"I stopped masking at home and my partner says I'm becoming \\\"impossible\\\"\", url: \"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1putz9p/i_stopped_masking_at_home_and_my_partner_says_im/\";\n      link: \"r/TwoXChromosomes icon r/TwoXChromosomes\", expanded: False, url: \"/r/TwoXChromosomes/\";\n      link: \"I stopped masking at home and my partner says I'm becoming \\\"impossible\\\"\", url: \"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1putz9p/i_stopped_masking_at_home_and_my_partner_says_im/\";\n      link: \"I (32F) got diagnosed this year after a long spiral of burnout that I kept calling \\\"just stress\\\" for basically a decade. The part that hit me hardest was realizing how much masking I do, even at home. I always acted like the TV being loud was fine, like surprise guests were fine, like being touched from behind while I'm cooking was fine. I smiled, made jokes, drank wine to take the edge off, and then crashed later in the bathroom with the fan on because I felt like my skin was buzzing. My therapist suggested I try doing the opposite: stop pretending. So lately when I get home from work I put on my noise-canceling headphones, I sit in the bedroom with the light low for 20-30 min, and I ask for no questions until I've decompressed. I also started doing small routines on purpose (same dinner schedule, same grocery list, Sunday laundry) because it keeps my brain from melting. It sounds so boring written out, but it makes me feel normal-ish. The thing is, my partner (34M) says I'm \\\"turning the house into a museum\\\" and that he feels like he has to tiptoe around me. He keeps saying stuff like \\\"you never used to be like this\\\" which is making me want to scream because I DID used to be like this, I just hid it. I can feel myself getting snappy when he plays videos on his phone at full volume or turns on the blender right when I walk in, and he gets mad that I react. He also takes it personally when I flinch or pull away if he tries to hug me while I'm still in that fragile post-work state. He says I'm rejecting him and making him feel unwanted. Last night was the worst. I asked him (calmly, I swear) if we could keep the living room quieter after 9 because that's when I start getting overstimulated and my head starts pounding. He rolled his eyes and said, \\\"So now there are rules. Great. Can't wait to see what else your diagnosis lets you control.\\\" That line felt like a slap. I told him it's not control, it's access, like ramps are not \\\"controlling\\\" stairs. He laughed and said I'm comparing him to a building, and that I'm using therapy words to make him the bad guy. Then he said he misses the \\\"fun version\\\" of me that would stay up late and watch shows and be spontaneous. I tried to explain that fun version was me running on fumes, and that I was basically dissociating half the time. He stared at me and said, \\\"Honestly, it just sounds like you don't want a relationship.\\\" I went to bed early and he slept on the couch by choice. Today he acted normal and I feel insane , like maybe I did overreact. But I'm also starting to dread evenings because I know the minute I ask for something I need, he hears it as an accusation.
