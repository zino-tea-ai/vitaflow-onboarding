I smiled, made jokes, drank wine to take the edge off, and then crashed later in the bathroom with the fan on because I felt like my skin was buzzing. My therapist suggested I try doing the opposite: stop pretending. So lately when I get home from work I put on my noise-canceling headphones, I sit in the bedroom with the light low for 20-30 min, and I ask for no questions until I've decompressed. I also started doing small routines on purpose (same dinner schedule, same grocery list, Sunday laundry) because it keeps my brain from melting. It sounds so boring written out, but it makes me feel normal-ish. The thing is, my partner (34M) says I'm \"turning the house into a museum\" and that he feels like he has to tiptoe around me. He keeps saying stuff like \"you never used to be like this\" which is making me want to scream because I DID used to be like this, I just hid it. I can feel myself getting snappy when he plays videos on his phone at full volume or turns on the blender right when I walk in, and he gets mad that I react. He also takes it personally when I flinch or pull away if he tries to hug me while I'm still in that fragile post-work state. He says I'm rejecting him and making him feel unwanted. Last night was the worst. I asked him (calmly, I swear) if we could keep the living room quieter after 9 because that's when I start getting overstimulated and my head starts pounding. He rolled his eyes and said, \"So now there are rules. Great. Can't wait to see what else your diagnosis lets you control.\" That line felt like a slap. I told him it's not control, it's access, like ramps are not \"controlling\" stairs. He laughed and said I'm comparing him to a building, and that I'm using therapy words to make him the bad guy. Then he said he misses the \"fun version\" of me that would stay up late and watch shows and be spontaneous. I tried to explain that fun version was me running on fumes, and that I was basically dissociating half the time. He stared at me and said, \"Honestly, it just sounds like you don't want a relationship.\" I went to bed early and he slept on the couch by choice.

Went on a nightmare Hinge date last night with a guy who seemed nice over text. I\u2019m not the cutest woman. I\u2019m 23, a bit chubby, and don\u2019t look like an influencer. And that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m fine with myself and have accordingly lowered my dating expectations. I don\u2019t expect a Prince Charming. This guy was also average looking. 5\u20198 with one of those bulky type builds. For context we\u2019re both South Asian. The whole date, he was making passive aggressive comments to me. I genuinely don\u2019t know if he thought I was clueless or if he WANTED me to pick up what he was putting down. It started with things like, \u201cI think a guy like me who works out 6 days/week deserves a girl who takes care of herself. Huge turn-off if she doesn\u2019t work out and lets herself go.\u201d This was after I had already told him I don\u2019t really work out. I wanted to comment on the fact that even if he works out 6 days a week, it doesn\u2019t show in his build, but I bit my tongue.

I\u2019ll call him Dave. First, some things about me. I have had more trauma in my life than anyone should ever have to deal with. I grew up in a fundamentalist home with lots of emotional, physical and sexual abuse from my mother, my stepfather and the church. I won\u2019t get into the details but it left me with a horrible fear of any males and zero self-esteem. I have only been on one real date in my life. I was a freshman in college and he tried to force himself on me and then he called me all kinds of horrible things when I said no. I have been in therapy off and on since I was 17 but I know I still have a long way to go. I never finished college because of my PTSD, anxiety and OCD. I also think I am probably on the spectrum but it\u2019s never been officially diagnosed. For whatever reason I am very awkward in social situations and always manage to say the wrong things. A few years ago I decided to become an EMT. I know maybe not the best choice for someone as fucked up as I am. About a year and a half ago I got a job with a private ambulance service. I don\u2019t do 911 calls. I just do ambulance transfers between hospitals for the most part. I am usually partnered with a paramedic so most of what I do is just drive the ambulance and do grunt work for the paramedic. None of the paramedics at the base I was in wanted to work with me. They gave me the choice of moving to a different base an hour from my apartment or being let go about a year ago. I took the transfer. Dave is the paramedic at that base that they give the problem EMT\u2019s to because he\u2019s really good with people and a great trainer. It\u2019s basically a last chance. If you can\u2019t work with Dave and become a good EMT then you can\u2019t work with anyone and need to find a different gig. Dave is a single dad with 3 kids, M28, M24, and F21. The boys are out of college and on their own. The girl is in college out of state. I clicked with Dave from the start. He was very patient with me and he figured out my anxiety and OCD right off the bat but he never asked me to explain where they came from. He never criticized me even when I screwed up. He treated everything as a learning experience and he even came up with ways to make my OCD work with what I needed to be doing. We spend a lot of time together in the cab of the truck between calls either posted at a hospital waiting for calls or driving back from calls because most of our transports are to major hospitals over an hour away. I was very nervous about being with a man in that situation for a long time but I eventually started really trusting him. He is the first male I have trusted like that in my life. A few months ago we had to transport a girl who had been very seriously sexually abused. The mother rode in the back of the ambulance with Dave and the patient. I was barely holding it together up front because it was bringing up all my old trauma. Dave saw that I was really upset and he drove back. We talked along the way and I started revealing some of the things that happened to me. He was so supportive and kind that the dam just burst and I let it all out. I even told him things I have never even told any of my therapists. I was a basket case by the time we needed to stop for gas. He asked me if I wanted him to hug me and I said yes. He held me for probably 10 minutes while I sobbed uncontrollably. I got myself together (sort of) and we finished our shift. That was our last call of the shift. I found out later that while Dave was pumping gas he called dispatch and asked them not to give us another call unless it was unavoidable. He just told them that it was a really emotionally tough call for both of us and we\u2019d appreciate a little time to process it. We kept talking. Dave told me he was really glad that I opened up and got all of that off my chest and that I could talk to him anytime I needed to and that I could even call him at home. I\u2019m not in therapy right now, and he said he would help me find a therapist if I wanted. Yeah I know I need to. It was like a switch flipped in me. The biggest thing to me was when he asked me if I wanted him to hug me. That was the first time in my life that a male asked me if I want to be touched instead of just touching me however they wanted to. I know it\u2019s a small thing but I can\u2019t describe how huge it was for me. Up to that point I couldn\u2019t even fantasize about anything sexual with a man because it would trigger my anxiety and I would have a panic attack. I went through his FB page. There were pictures of him when he was my age and I started fantasizing about being with him at that age. He\u2019s still a very good looking man so before long I started fantasizing about what sex with him would be like now because he is the one man I know would be gentle and kind. He\u2019s the only man I would trust to be that vulnerable with. I am 26 years old, and I want to experience that even if it\u2019s just one night. We had our company Christmas party a few nights ago. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of him. It was the first time I saw him outside of work. I had a few drinks which is very unusual for me. I wasn\u2019t drunk but definitely tipsy. I finally got a little time alone with him and I told him how much that hug meant to me and why. But stupid me didn\u2019t stop there. I asked him if he would hook up with me to show me what it should be like instead like the nightmares I have endured. His reaction was classic Dave. He smiled at me and told me he was very flattered but he didn\u2019t think that would be a good idea. He said he would feel like he was taking advantage of me and my issues. He also said that he can\u2019t imagine being with anyone his kids age and that he doesn't want to get physically involved with any coworker. His rejection hurt but honestly he was so kind and gentle about it that it made my feelings even stronger. But now I know I probably ruined the only really good relationship I've ever had with a male in my whole life. He is on a 2 week vacation with his kids for Christmas so I haven\u2019t had any contact with him since that night. I am probably just gonna ghost my job now so I won\u2019t be there when he gets back. I know I am never going to have any kind of intimacy with him but I am going crazy trying to think of some way to fix my screwup. Until that night my mental health was the best it has ever been and that\u2019s mainly due to having Dave as my partner for the last year. He\u2019s been better for me than any of the therapists I\u2019ve seen. Should I just quit my job or is there some way I can make him want to still be part of my life? I honestly don't know what to do other than run away. I don't have close friends and I've been NC with all my family for years. TL;DR: I let my feelings for a an older coworker get out of hand and asked him to hook up with me.
