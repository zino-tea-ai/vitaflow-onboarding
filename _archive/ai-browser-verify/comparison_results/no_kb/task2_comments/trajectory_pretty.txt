<reasoning>
We are on the Hacker News front page. Need to open the comments page for the 5th story. In the accessibility tree, the 5th story has a title row and the following subtext row contains the link "80 comments" which navigates to the item (comments) page. No knowledge_base functions are available (functions list is empty), so we will use Playwright get_by_role selectors only. To avoid ambiguous selection, we scope the comments link within the specific subtext row identified by its full accessible name containing "220 points by medv ... | 80 comments" and then click the "80 comments" link. Since this click navigates away, it will be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
import asyncio

async def act(page):
    # Click the comments link for the 5th story ("80 comments") within its specific subtext row.
    await page.get_by_role(
        "row",
        name="220 points by medv 5 hours ago | hide | 80 comments"
    ).get_by_role("link", name="80 comments").click()

</code>

What it does: Single HTML file, no deps, 111 loc Notes live in the URL hash (shareable links!) Auto-compressed with CompressionStream Plain-text editor (contenteditable) History support Page title from first # heading Respects light/dark mode No storage, cookies, or tracking The entire app is the page source. https://textarea.my/ add comment upvote gnyman 2 hours ago | [–] Funny how I made almost exactly the same but for maps. I needed a way to share a link to a map, with drawings and the ability for the receiver to see their own location on the map. Annotated screenshots solves the first but not the second. Vibe engineered this, with many of the same ideas as OP. Took an evening. Just in time apps for one specific use case is a thing. And because it's so cheap to make and can be hosted cheaply with no backend, it can be given away for free. https://nyman.re/mapdraw/#l=60.172108%2C24.941458&z=16&d=LU8... reply upvote mathgeek 1 hour ago | | [–] > Vibe engineered While I'm all for vibe coding as appropriate, there's a lot of humor to be found it calling it engineering. :D reply upvote block_dagger 1 hour ago | | | [–] Fair. Though it seems that half of engineering is just giving a respectable name to whatever actually works. reply upvote mathgeek 1 hour ago | | | [–] For software, but that's a well trodden path at this point. I've seen a few projects that are actually \"vibe engineering\" outside of software on the 3d modeling side so the terms are confusing. reply upvote Gehinnn 1 hour ago | | | [–] This is very cool! reply upvote RandomDistort 1 hour ago | | | [–] Is this open source? reply upvote roxolotl 3 hours ago | | [–] Was just working on something similar this morning.

I know this isn't meant to be super secure, but it's still worth a mention. reply upvote throwaway150 3 hours ago | | [–] Typos aren't making the hash part turn into something else. Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 1 hour ago | | [–] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail.

It's less about the limits of a URL and more about practicality. I also have no way to confirm that URLs aren't logged server side, so I'd never trust the claim about \"no tracking\". That's why these projects also end up self-hosted. reply upvote denisinvader 3 hours ago | [–] hash part of url only available in the browser, as far as I know, server doesn’t have access to # value reply upvote jamesdwilson 2 hours ago | | | [–] very easy for the server to intentionally (or by compromise) add a one liner to send the hash text up. reply upvote sublinear 3 hours ago | | | [–] Typos and URL mangles are common though, and I'd still have no way to confirm if it got logged in that case. It's out of scope for anything in the github source, and instead depends on the server hosting the page. I know this isn't meant to be super secure, but it's still worth a mention. reply upvote throwaway150 3 hours ago | | [–] Typos aren't making the hash part turn into something else. Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 1 hour ago | | [–] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail. There's endless footguns with URLs. reply" {

Context: In my locality, EA, we normally have Whatsapp groups raising funds for whatever reason; for every content edit, the admin has to copy-edit-paste updated content(which contains name and amount) to the group. This small app intends to provide a table that's easy to convey this info. App stores content in the url but a preview image (needed for Whatsapp share) is stored at R2.

It's out of scope for anything in the github source, and instead depends on the server hosting the page. I know this isn't meant to be super secure, but it's still worth a mention. reply upvote throwaway150 3 hours ago | | [–] Typos aren't making the hash part turn into something else. Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 1 hour ago | | [–] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail. There's endless footguns with URLs. reply" {
