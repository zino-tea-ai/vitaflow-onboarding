  "reasoning": "Useful skill candidates for Hacker News (avoid login/account actions):\n\n1) Search Hacker News for a query and open the first result\n- Natural-language name: \u201cSearch Hacker News and open top result\u201d\n- Parameters: query, open_result_index=1\n- Usefulness (1-5): 5 (very common; compresses typing + scanning + navigation)\n- Steps (actions counted after listing):\n  1. Click Search box\n  2. Type query\n  3. Press Enter/submit\n  4. Click result #N\n  => 4 actions\n- Sum rating = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n2) Filter the front page to only stories from a given domain (site)\n- Natural-language name: \u201cShow only stories from a domain\u201d\n- Parameters: domain\n- Usefulness: 4 (common research workflow; turns browsing into targeted filtering)\n- Steps:\n  1. Find and click the domain link next to any matching story (or use URL parameter from?site=...)\n  2. (If needed) edit/enter domain in the URL/query\n  3. Load page\n  => ~3 actions\n- Sum rating = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n3) Open a story\u2019s comments and sort by newest\n- Natural-language name: \u201cOpen comments for a story and sort by newest\u201d\n- Parameters: story_rank or title_contains\n- Usefulness: 4 (frequent; adds a preference-based view)\n- Steps:\n  1. Click \u201cX comments\u201d for the chosen story\n  2. Click \u201cnewest\u201d (or equivalent sorting option if present)\n  => 2 actions\n- Sum rating = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4) Hide multiple stories on the front page that match keywords/domains\n- Natural-language name: \u201cHide front-page stories matching filters\u201d\n- Parameters: title_keywords (list), domains (list), max_to_hide\n- Usefulness: 5 (power-user cleanup; compresses repetitive actions)\n- Steps (for k stories hidden):\n  1. Scan page for matches (no click)\n  2. Click \u201chide\u201d for match #1\n  3. Click \u201chide\u201d for match #2\n  ...\n  => k actions (typically 3-10)\n- For typical k=5: 5 actions\n- Sum rating = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n5) Open the top N stories in new tabs\n- Natural-language name: \u201cOpen top N stories in new tabs\u201d\n- Parameters: n\n- Usefulness: 3 (common, but mostly repetitive link opening)\n- Steps:\n  1. For each of N stories: open link in new tab\n  => N actions\n- For N=10: 10 actions\n- Sum rating = 3 + 10 = 13 (high sum but mostly brute-force; less \u2018shortcut\u2019 value than filtering/hiding)\n\n6) Go to a section (new/past/comments/ask/show/jobs) and apply a quick scan filter (highlight matches)\n- Natural-language name: \u201cSwitch section and highlight stories matching query\u201d\n- Parameters: section, query\n- Usefulness: 4\n- Steps:\n  1. Click section link\n  2. Use browser find / injected highlight\n  => 2 actions\n- Sum rating = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nHighest sum rating: #5 has 13 but is essentially just repeated tab opens (less valuable as an intelligent shortcut). The best high-value shortcut that compresses multiple interactions with meaningful filtering is #4.\n\nSelected skill: \u201cHide front-page stories matching filters\u201d."
