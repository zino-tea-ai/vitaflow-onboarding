  "reasoning": "Potential useful skills (Python function shortcuts) for Hacker News:\n\n1) Search Hacker News for a query and open top N results\n- What it does: uses the Search box to run a query, then opens the first N matching items (titles) in new tabs/windows.\n- Usefulness: 5 (very common task; compresses query + scanning + opening)\n- Steps (actions):\n  1. Click Search input\n  2. Type query\n  3. Press Enter/submit\n  4. Click result #1\n  5. Click result #2\n  ... up to N\n  => For N=3: 6 actions total\n- Rating sum: 5 + 6 = 11\n\n2) Filter front page by site/domain (via \u201cfrom\u201d link) for a specific story\n- What it does: finds a story by title text, clicks its domain (\u201cfrom\u201d) link to show all stories from that site.\n- Usefulness: 4 (common investigative workflow)\n- Steps:\n  1. Locate story row by title contains text\n  2. Click the site/domain link (e.g., \u201cfrom?site=...\u201d) next to it\n  => 2 actions\n- Rating sum: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3) Open the comments page for a story by rank number\n- What it does: from the front page, open the \u201cX comments/discuss\u201d link for item at a given rank.\n- Usefulness: 3 (frequent but simple)\n- Steps:\n  1. Click \u201ccomments\u201d (or \u201cdiscuss\u201d) for that rank\n  => 1 action\n- Rating sum: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n4) Hide multiple stories on the front page matching keywords\n- What it does: scans visible items and clicks \u201chide\u201d for any whose title matches any keyword.\n- Usefulness: 4 (useful personalization; multiple interactions)\n- Steps (for K matched stories):\n  1..K: Click \u201chide\u201d for each matched story\n  => K actions (often 3\u201310)\n- Example K=5: 5 actions\n- Rating sum (K=5): 4 + 5 = 9\n\n5) Navigate to a specific section (new/past/comments/ask/show/jobs/submit)\n- What it does: clicks the top nav link for a given section.\n- Usefulness: 2 (single click; too trivial)\n- Steps: 1 action\n- Rating sum: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nHighest rating: Skill #1 (Search Hacker News for a query and open top N results) with sum 11."
