I need to click on the 'new' link in the navigation to go to the newest submissions page. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a link with name 'new' and url 'newest' in the navigation area. I'll click on that link to navigate to the newest submissions page, then I'll need to get the title of the first news item from that page.

<code>
await page.get_by_role("link", name="new").first.click(timeout=15000)
