I need to click on the search/hn search link to search for 'AI'. Looking at the accessibility tree, I don't see a direct 'search' link on the main navigation. However, I know that Hacker News has a search feature through hn.algolia.com or through a link at the bottom of the page. Let me scroll down to find a search link, or I can navigate directly to the HN Search page. Looking at the current page, I don't see a search link in the header. The common way to search HN is to go to hn.algolia.com. Let me navigate there directly.

<code>
await page.goto('https://hn.algolia.com/', timeout=15000)

<reasoning>
I'm on the Hacker News Search page (hn.algolia.com). I can see a searchbox that says 'Search stories by title, url or author'. I need to search for 'AI' and return the title of the first search result. Let me type 'AI' in the search box and then check the results.
</reasoning>

<code>
await page.get_by_role("searchbox", name="Search stories by title, url or author").first.fill("AI", timeout=15000)
await page.keyboard.press("Enter")
await page.wait_for_timeout(2000)
</code>

<exception>
'TypeError': Keyboard.press() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'
</exception>
