  "prompt": "You generate Playwright code to interact with websites.\n - If you want to click a generic button (e.g. that belongs to an element), use the full `.get_by_role()` path to\n   the element (e.g. .get_by_role(\"group\", name=\"Test Item\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\")\n   instead of .get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\"), as this is ambiguous)\n - Write exceptionally *correct* Python code.\n - You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge_base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Search for 'machine learning' on this website.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'All | Search powered by Algolia', with the url 'https://hn.algolia.com/?q=machine+learning'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nWe need to use Hacker News built-in search box in the footer. No knowledge_base functions are provided, so we interact directly with Playwright. Plan: locate the search textbox by role, fill 'machine learning', and press Enter to submit. This will navigate to results; since navigation occurs, make it last action.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def act(page):\n    # Hacker News search field is in the footer.\n    search_box = page.get_by_role(\"textbox\", name=\"Search\")\n    await search_box.fill(\"machine learning\")\n    # Submit search (navigates away to results)\n    await search_box.press(\"Enter\")\n\n</code>\n\n<exception>\n'TimeoutError': Locator.fill: Timeout 5000ms exceeded.\nCall log:\n  - waiting for get_by_role(\"textbox\", name=\"Search\")\n\n</exception>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nNo knowledge_base functions are available, so we must use Playwright role-based selectors. The prior failure indicates the Search input isn\u2019t exposed as a textbox with accessible name \"Search\". On Hacker News, the footer has visible text \"Search:\" followed by an unlabeled input; in the accessibility tree this often appears as a generic textbox with no accessible name. We can reliably: scroll to bottom, then select the last textbox on the page (the footer search field), fill the query, and press Enter to submit (navigation expected).\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def act(page):\n    # No knowledge base functions available for this task.\n\n    # The Search box is in the footer; scroll to ensure it's attached/visible.\n    await page.evaluate(\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)\")\n\n    # On HN the footer search input often has no accessible name;\n    # select the last textbox on the page (the footer search field).\n    search_box = page.get_by_role(\"textbox\").last\n    await search_box.wait_for(state=\"visible\", timeout=10000)\n    await search_box.fill(\"machine learning\")\n\n    # Submit the search (navigation expected).\n    await search_box.press(\"Enter\")\n\n</code>\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"All | Search

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n"
