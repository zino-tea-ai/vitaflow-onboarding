You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Microsoft please get your tab to autocomplete shit together | Hacker News', with the url 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46380475'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nWe need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the Hacker News front page. In the accessibility tree, the 3rd item has a separate row for metadata containing the link \"36 comments\" (url: item). Clicking that link opens the discussion page. No knowledge_base functions are available (functions list is empty), so we use direct Playwright locator clicks. To avoid ambiguity, use the full get_by_role path: from the table -> rowgroup -> row with the 3rd item title -> then select the subsequent metadata row containing \"78 points by AmbroseBierce ... | 36 comments\" and click its \"36 comments\" link. Clicking navigates away, so it should be the last action.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Click the comments link for the 3rd item\n    await page.get_by_role(\"table\").get_by_role(\"rowgroup\").get_by_role(\n        \"row\",\n        name=\"78 points by AmbroseBierce 1 hour ago | hide | 36 comments\",\n    ).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"36 comments\").click()\n\n</code>\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"Microsoft please get your tab to autocomplete shit together | Hacker News\" {\n  table {\n    rowgroup {\n      row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n        cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n          table {\n            rowgroup {\n              row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n                cell {\n                  link, url: \"\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit\" {\n                  link: \"Hacker News\", url: \"news\";\n                  link: \"new\", url: \"newest\";\n                  link: \"past\", url: \"front\";\n                  link: \"comments\", url: \"newcomments\";\n                  link: \"ask\", url: \"ask\";\n                  link: \"show\", url: \"show\";\n                  link: \"jobs\", url: \"jobs\";\n                  link: \"submit\", url: \"submit\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"login\" {\n                  link: \"login\", url: \"login\";\n                };\n              };\n            };\n          };\n        };\n      };\n\n      row;\n      row: \"upvote Microsoft please get your tab to autocomplete shit together (ivanca.github.io) 78 points by AmbroseBierce 1 hour ago | hide | past | favorite | 36 comments add comment upvote Someone1234 35 minutes ago | [\u2013] This is a company that cannot get \\\"basic file search\\\" working on their OS for 30+ years, I'm hardly holding my breath as they double-down on overcomplexity with even more overcomplexity.

Which is overwhelmingly the VS Code experience for any language. Everything feels shaky. I've had to report a bunch of irritating issues like the post for TypeScript - never fixed or resolved. I have never needed to report issues like this for C# in Visual Studio, and when I have tried C# in VS Code the experience makes me wonder if it's a bad joke. reply upvote giancarlostoro 1 hour ago | [\u2013] Microsoft VS peaked for me in 2013 to 2017 when they decoupled a bunch of things, specifically .NET reply upvote CharlieDigital 56 minutes ago | [\u2013] .NET feels better than ever right now.
