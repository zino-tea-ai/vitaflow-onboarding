Just make sure it has a quarter of the information density of the old one and takes up twice the screen space.\" I haven't used Win11 enough to discover how they have managed to further degrade the experience, but at least it looks nicer. reply upvote koakuma-chan 14 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Ditch VSCode, switch to Zed. reply upvote citbl 2 minutes ago | | [\u2013] There are still plenty of things that VSCode does and Zed doesn't. E.g. Dart debugging. Also there is the VC money problem with Zed, at some point, that money will want returns on every dollar spent. reply upvote shadester88 10 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I didnt think I would ever switch from vscode but Zed is very nice and my daily driver now. reply upvote freetonik 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] Looks like Unity code. Not sure if it\u2019s Visual Studio or VS Code, but yeah, it was baffling to me how weirdly bad C# support in either IDE is. Maybe something wrong with my setup, but autocompletions indeed suck (in addition to just wrong picks, editors often would suggest a symbol that doesn\u2019t make sense from the typing perspective, as if there aren\u2019t any language servers or intellisense or whatever). VS code would also eat up the curly brace at the end of a class declaration when auto-generating a method skeleton. I gave up and installed Rider. So far so good. reply upvote PacificSpecific 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] They say it's vscode in the article. I can't say I've seen anything that egregious happen with unity in visual studio. It's stuff like this though that keeps me from using vscode for code editing (I use it for markdown and JSON file editing only). I guess I don't know what I'm missing but it's never been a smooth experience for me. If I'm on Windows I tend to stick with visual studio.

How can we make it better?\" Exec2: \"why not replace the perfectly good start menu we have with an ugly, oddly proportioned rectangle with animated ads for our products.\" Exec3: \"Sounds great!

So when I tab a file path, it shoves the absolute path into the partially typed path making it unusable. reply upvote kace91 3 minutes ago | | [\u2013] It\u2019s so weird, vscode worked flawlessly for me for years and after migrating to neovim a month or two ago I keep seeing complains. Has there been a change lately and in the project, or is it just internet bias? reply upvote smj-edison 13 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] Ohh, that's what has been happening when I've had tab completion fail recently! Thanks for mentioning it... reply upvote causal 21 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] Yeah for anyone else (especially Mac and Linux users) who recently had this frustration thrust upon you: Go into VSCode settings and search for terminal integration > uncheck. reply upvote tsujamin 29 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I thought I was going crazy, but it started feeling materially worse sometime in last few weeks. reply upvote diath 50 minutes ago | | [\u2013] It's because Tab accepts copilot suggestion, you have to press Enter instead to accept the language server suggestion. reply upvote Someone1234 28 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Yes, and what a mess it has been. Intellisense + Intellicode + Roslynator (extension) combined were really the height of productivity in Visual Studio. Now they've driven a steam-roller over all of that, forced CoPilot down our throats. I LIKE CoPilot's \"chat\" interface, and agents are fine too (although Claude in VS Code is tons better), but CoPilot auto-complete is negative value and shouldn't be used. reply upvote mcv 16 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I hate the time unpredictability of it. Intellij also has AI completion suggestions, and sometimes they're really useful. But sometimes when I expect them, they don't come. Or they briefly flash and then disappear. What would be nice is if you could ask for a suggestion with one key, so it's there when I want it, and not when I don't. That would put me in control. Instead I feel subjected to these completely random whims of the AI. reply upvote itissid 21 minutes ago | | [\u2013] There was a time when if you edited documentation in vscode and had copilot on it would complete internal user and project names when it encountered a path on some.random LLM project we were building. I could find people and their projects by just googling the username and contextual keywords. We all had a lot of laughs with tab auto complete and wondered in anticipation what ridiculous stuff it threw up next. reply upvote tiotempestade 3 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Why do people still spend time worrying about M$ stuff\u2026 reply upvote jimbo808 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] I wonder if 30% of their code being written by AI has anything to do with it reply upvote stefan_ 20 minutes ago | | [\u2013] 30% of code written by AI, but 100% of tools must be enshittified with the terrible and behind Microsoft Copilot even if it means you will blow up the goodwill for VS Code in a matter of months reply upvote OptionOfT 59 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Reminds me of Windows Search. It's been botched since they added ads to the Start Menu. Pretty soon VSCode will show you intellisense ads in the list of code completions. reply upvote Someone1234 26 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Windows Search requires a DNS lookup, and HTTP request to start your search, as a direct result if either one of those is slow the whole UI lags and hangs. It hasn't ever been fixed in Windows 11. Also, there is a RegX way of disabling \"bing\" for-real in the search but they released and update that caused doing so to break search entirely if that was set (totally a coincidence I'm sure). reply upvote OptionOfT 13 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I have resorted to installing my laptop with Ireland / English & later switching the region to US / English. That way it's considered part of the European Economic Area. Which allows me to disable web search in start, disable widgets, etc. reply upvote FridayoLeary 22 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I'm convinced that the win10 Start Menu was the single worst thing microsoft inflicted upon us in that OS. I imagine that particular discussion went like this: Exec1:\"We have a semi decent os with a refreshingly updated UI that should stay relevant for a decade. How can we make it better?\" Exec2: \"why not replace the perfectly good start menu we have with an ugly, oddly proportioned rectangle with animated ads for our products.\" Exec3: \"Sounds great! Just make sure it has a quarter of the information density of the old one and takes up twice the screen space.\" I haven't used Win11 enough to discover how they have managed to further degrade the experience, but at least it looks nicer. reply upvote koakuma-chan 14 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Ditch VSCode, switch to Zed. reply upvote citbl 2 minutes ago | | [\u2013] There are still plenty of things that VSCode does and Zed doesn't. E.g. Dart debugging.

Not sure if it\u2019s Visual Studio or VS Code, but yeah, it was baffling to me how weirdly bad C# support in either IDE is. Maybe something wrong with my setup, but autocompletions indeed suck (in addition to just wrong picks, editors often would suggest a symbol that doesn\u2019t make sense from the typing perspective, as if there aren\u2019t any language servers or intellisense or whatever). VS code would also eat up the curly brace at the end of a class declaration when auto-generating a method skeleton. I gave up and installed Rider. So far so good. reply upvote PacificSpecific 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] They say it's vscode in the article. I can't say I've seen anything that egregious happen with unity in visual studio. It's stuff like this though that keeps me from using vscode for code editing (I use it for markdown and JSON file editing only). I guess I don't know what I'm missing but it's never been a smooth experience for me. If I'm on Windows I tend to stick with visual studio. Maybe I should consider rider... reply upvote piskov 31 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Jetbrains Rider is very nice. Especially with ideavim plugin. And pretty fast these fast these days. reply upvote luxuryballs 7 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Visual Studio has been doing wacky stuff to me like this when I am trying to start a LINQ statement and type a letter to be the lambda variable like Select(f => \u2026 but when I hit \u2018f\u2019 it just autocompletes some random model from some .NET api that starts with F that I then have to delete because why would I want FileStreamCombulator right now I\u2019m trying to start a lambda??? and don\u2019t remember it doing this in the past. reply upvote mfro 52 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Pretty sure you\u2019re supposed to press return in order to accept a dropdown suggestion.

The project is open source and invites feedback in the form of issues, although sadly their issue report page is a bit of a cesspool - will really make you lose faith in humanity. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues I think maybe vibe coders got to it and don\u2019t realize that there are certain requirements to create useful feedback? Or maybe VS Code linking from the help menu is a bad idea. This blog post is a step above the \u201cdoesn\u2019t work is garbage\u201d issues filed in GitHub, but only just one.

Which is overwhelmingly the VS Code experience for any language. Everything feels shaky. I've had to report a bunch of irritating issues like the post for TypeScript - never fixed or resolved.
