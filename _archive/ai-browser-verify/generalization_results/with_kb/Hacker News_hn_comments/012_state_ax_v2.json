different days and time zones are a thing. But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect. Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people. To make sure this post meets the relevancy criteria, here is a Wikipedia article about some Christmas (more precisely advent) tradition which I personally really like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market add comment upvote Grosvenor 1 hour ago | [\u2013] * , _/^\\_ < > * /.-.\\ * * `/&\\` * ,@.*;@, /_o.I %_\\ * * (`'--:o(_@; /`;--.,__ `') * ;@`o % O,*`'`&\\ * (`'--)_@ ;o %'()\\ * /`;--._`''--._O'@; /&*,()~o`;-.,_ `\"\"`) * /`,@ ;+& () o*`;-';\\ (`\"\"--.,_0 +% @' &()\\ /-.,_ ``''--....-'`) * * /@%;o`:;'--,.__ __.'\\ ;*,&(); @ % &^;~`\"`o;@(); * /(); o^~; & ().o@*&`;&%O\\ jgs `\"=\"==\"\"==,,,.,=\"==\"===\"` __.----.(\\-''#####---...___...-----._ '` \\)_`\"\"\"\"\"` .--' ') o( )_-\\ `\"\"\"` ` reply upvote OptionOfT 32 minutes ago | | [\u2013] I thought this was Advent of Code!

I\u2019m struck by honestly what a miracle it is that we can travel thousands of miles at hundreds of MPH and have okay internet access and communicate. I don\u2019t think people quite realise how delicate all of the technology is now and how easily it could fail if we don\u2019t all look after each other.

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me. I recently moved countries for a new job, but I moved a bit too soon. Now I am spending the holiday season alone for the first time in my life.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December.

My father and mother have departed.

But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect. Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [\u2013] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren\u2019t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It\u2019s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won\u2019t see it like that but it\u2019s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [\u2013] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [\u2013] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.
