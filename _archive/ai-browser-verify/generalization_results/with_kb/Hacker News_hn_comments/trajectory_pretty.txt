<reasoning>
We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd front-page item. A knowledge_base function exists: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank) which navigates to /news and clicks the comments/discuss link for the given rank. This exactly matches the task and is more robust than crafting selectors manually. We'll call it with rank=3. Clicking it navigates away, so it should be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread for rank 3.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect. Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.

Merry Christmas! reply upvote andy_ppp 51 minutes ago | | [–] Happy Christmas everyone, I’m at 29000 feet on a flight to Hong Kong after a mini version of planes, trains and automobiles and including cancelled planes and taxis to different airports.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page. A knowledge base function exists: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank) which navigates to /news and opens the comments/discuss link for the story at the given 1-based rank. This directly accomplishes the task from our current state (we’re on an item page), so we should call it with rank=3. This will navigate away, so it must be the last action.

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Open the comments/discussion thread for the 3rd item on the HN front page.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone. Being a non-Christian and it being Christmas time, I am sharing one verse from the New Testament that is, in my opinion, useful - or at the very least, insightful - to anyone, regardless of religion.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

I haven't seen my family in many, many years for reasons that I don't want to get into. I am a founder. I check Hacker News every day and have learned an immense amount from all the commenters, articles, and discussions over the years. I thank you all for that. I am truly grateful. I wish you all a Merry Christmas full of joy, and I hope you can all appreciate, share, and express love for those around you, be it family, friends, or strangers on the internet. We are all very lucky to be part of the HN site and community. I have been here for about 15 years (at least that is what it feels like) with my other accounts that I don't want to dox. Glory to God. For believers in Jesus, may the light of Christ guide you as it does me in difficult times.

Stuck alone during COVID in 2021 in a really bad place. I couldn't sleep. And I happened to turn on the radio in the middle of the night and there was an Amy Grant interview. I almost turned it off, oh no, christian stuff I thought. But she talked about her first Christmas without her mom. Then they played her song about it. If I had been 5 minutes more trying to sleep, or given up on sleep 5 minutes earlier, I would have missed that. Anyways, in case anyone needs to stumble upon something similar, I couldn't find something so perfect but... hearing it now it's not as amazing as it was that night I needed to not be alone in grief, but here it is: https://www.npr.org/2016/12/25/506715971/amy-grant-on-faith-... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LOqLV6Om4A Merry Christmas to you! reply upvote adventured 35 minutes ago | | [–] Merry Christmas HN reply upvote tory 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas :) reply upvote kevinmhickey 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to all!! reply upvote sdobbie 26 minutes ago | | [–] Merry Christmas! reply upvote arjonagelhout 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas!

<reasoning>
We are currently on an HN item (comments) page, not on the HN front page list. The task asks to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page (i.e., the 3rd story on the HN front page). The knowledge_base provides `open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank)` which exactly performs this action by navigating to `/news` and clicking the appropriate comments/discuss link for the specified rank. Since navigation is expected, this should be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread for the 3rd item on the HN front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

Luke 16:10: He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. reply upvote tekacs 1 hour ago | | [–] Fun seeing HN restart to switch to the Christmas theme, in three steps: https://share.cleanshot.com/vJZv6k03 (restarting the server) https://share.cleanshot.com/qFyM347P (online but temporarily readonly) https://share.cleanshot.com/kW8kY7mp (back online!) reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | [–] You must have grabbed that first one awfully quickly! reply upvote andersa 1 hour ago | | | [–] So what's the christmas theme?

Jails have their own IP addresses and root filesystem, plus they use the host OS's version of libc and OpenSSL/LibreSSL and all the other core utils.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

Unless I'm blind, it looks the same as always, except the header color seems to have changed... slightly? reply upvote ojbyrne 30 minutes ago | | | [–] Perhaps you've looked at the site so much that you're blind to the numbers at the start of each item. reply upvote BubbleRings 4 minutes ago | | | [–] No numbers in Chrome on iPhone, fyi. reply upvote andersa 12 minutes ago | | | | [–] Oh, indeed reply upvote jaggederest 27 minutes ago | | | | [–] The numbers next to the submissions are red/green reply upvote brcmthrowaway 1 hour ago | | | [–] What container is this running in? reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | [–] FreeBSD reply upvote president_zippy 55 minutes ago | | | [–] Color me confused, but what do containers add to FreeBSD beyond jails? Jails have their own IP addresses and root filesystem, plus they use the host OS's version of libc and OpenSSL/LibreSSL and all the other core utils. Is it the convenience utilities for building and running container images? reply upvote dang 43 minutes ago | | | [–] I was joking. There is no container. (We don't use jails either.) reply upvote jagged-chisel 1 hour ago | | | [–] Restart?! ouch reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] HN is a pretty simple, efficient monolithic web application. Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

Side note: I assume you can’t call it ASCII art if it uses non-ASCII characters, but Unicode art doesn’t have the same ring. reply upvote rationalist 11 minutes ago | | | | [–] A Christmas tree through the snow? reply upvote gerdesj 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Fucked up Braille? reply upvote phodo 0 minutes ago | | [–] Prompt: create a christmas tree in ascii but that is a merkle tree Answer: Here’s an ASCII Christmas tree that is also a Merkle tree (Each parent node is the hash of its two children; leaves are the “data blocks”.) MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

<reasoning>
We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item (rank 3) on the Hacker News list page. We are currently on an HN item page, not the list. The knowledge base function `open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank)` exactly performs this action by navigating to `/news` and clicking the appropriate “comments”/“discuss” link for the given rank, so we should use it. This will navigate away, so it should be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread for the 3rd item on the HN front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect. Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people. To make sure this post meets the relevancy criteria, here is a Wikipedia article about some Christmas (more precisely advent) tradition which I personally really like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market add comment upvote Grosvenor 1 hour ago | [–] * , _/^\_ < > * /.-.\ * * `/&\` * ,@.*;@, /_o.I %_\ * * (`'--:o(_@; /`;--.,__ `') * ;@`o % O,*`'`&\ * (`'--)_@ ;o %'()\ * /`;--._`''--._O'@; /&*,()~o`;-.,_ `\"\"`) * /`,@ ;+& () o*`;-';\ (`\"\"--.,_0 +% @' &()\ /-.,_ ``''--....-'`) * * /@%;o`:;'--,.__ __.'\ ;*,&(); @ % &^;~`\"`o;@(); * /(); o^~; & ().o@*&`;&%O\ jgs `\"=\"==\"\"==,,,.,=\"==\"===\"` __.----.(\-''#####---...___...-----._ '` \)_`\"\"\"\"\"` .--' ') o( )_-\ `\"\"\"` ` reply upvote OptionOfT 30 minutes ago | | [–] I thought this was Advent of Code!

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same.

My father and mother have departed.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

<reasoning>
We are currently on an HN item/comments page, not on the HN list page. The task is to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the (HN front) page. A knowledge_base function exists: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank) which navigates to /news and clicks the comments/discuss link for the story at the given 1-based rank. This exactly matches the requested action and is preferable to crafting brittle selectors. We should call it with rank=3; since it navigates away, it must be the final action in act().
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Open the comments/discussion thread for the 3rd item on the HN front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season.

Side note: I assume you can’t call it ASCII art if it uses non-ASCII characters, but Unicode art doesn’t have the same ring. reply upvote rationalist 11 minutes ago | | | | [–] A Christmas tree through the snow? reply upvote gerdesj 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Fucked up Braille? reply upvote phodo 0 minutes ago | | [–] Prompt: create a christmas tree in ascii but that is a merkle tree Answer: Here’s an ASCII Christmas tree that is also a Merkle tree (Each parent node is the hash of its two children; leaves are the “data blocks”.) MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

I almost turned it off, oh no, christian stuff I thought. But she talked about her first Christmas without her mom. Then they played her song about it. If I had been 5 minutes more trying to sleep, or given up on sleep 5 minutes earlier, I would have missed that.

We are currently on an HN item/comments page (not the HN list). The task is to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page, which refers to the 3rd ranked story on the Hacker News front page (/news). A knowledge_base function exists that directly performs this action: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank). It navigates to /news and clicks the appropriate comments/discuss link for the given rank. Therefore, we should call it with rank=3. This navigation should be the last action in act().

    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread
    # for the 3rd item on the Hacker News front page.

But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect. Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people. To make sure this post meets the relevancy criteria, here is a Wikipedia article about some Christmas (more precisely advent) tradition which I personally really like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market add comment upvote Grosvenor 1 hour ago | [–] * , _/^\_ < > * /.-.\ * * `/&\` * ,@.*;@, /_o.I %_\ * * (`'--:o(_@; /`;--.,__ `') * ;@`o % O,*`'`&\ * (`'--)_@ ;o %'()\ * /`;--._`''--._O'@; /&*,()~o`;-.,_ `\"\"`) * /`,@ ;+& () o*`;-';\ (`\"\"--.,_0 +% @' &()\ /-.,_ ``''--....-'`) * * /@%;o`:;'--,.__ __.'\ ;*,&(); @ % &^;~`\"`o;@(); * /(); o^~; & ().o@*&`;&%O\ jgs `\"=\"==\"\"==,,,.,=\"==\"===\"` __.----.(\-''#####---...___...-----._ '` \)_`\"\"\"\"\"` .--' ') o( )_-\ `\"\"\"` ` reply upvote OptionOfT 30 minutes ago | | [–] I thought this was Advent of Code!

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone. Being a non-Christian and it being Christmas time, I am sharing one verse from the New Testament that is, in my opinion, useful - or at the very least, insightful - to anyone, regardless of religion.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

To make sure this post meets the relevancy criteria, here is a Wikipedia article about some Christmas (more precisely advent) tradition which I personally really like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market add comment upvote Grosvenor 1 hour ago | [–] * , _/^\_ < > * /.-.\ * * `/&\` * ,@.*;@, /_o.I %_\ * * (`'--:o(_@; /`;--.,__ `') * ;@`o % O,*`'`&\ * (`'--)_@ ;o %'()\ * /`;--._`''--._O'@; /&*,()~o`;-.,_ `\"\"`) * /`,@ ;+& () o*`;-';\ (`\"\"--.,_0 +% @' &()\ /-.,_ ``''--....-'`) * * /@%;o`:;'--,.__ __.'\ ;*,&(); @ % &^;~`\"`o;@(); * /(); o^~; & ().o@*&`;&%O\ jgs `\"=\"==\"\"==,,,.,=\"==\"===\"` __.----.(\-''#####---...___...-----._ '` \)_`\"\"\"\"\"` .--' ') o( )_-\ `\"\"\"` ` reply upvote OptionOfT 30 minutes ago | | [–] I thought this was Advent of Code!

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone. Being a non-Christian and it being Christmas time, I am sharing one verse from the New Testament that is, in my opinion, useful - or at the very least, insightful - to anyone, regardless of religion.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

<reasoning>
We are currently on an HN item/comments page, but the task is to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the Hacker News listing page. A knowledge base function exists that directly performs this action: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank). It navigates to /news and clicks the comments/discuss link for the story at the specified 1-based rank. Using it is required and is the most reliable approach. We'll call it with rank=3; since it navigates away, it will be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread
    # for the 3rd item on the Hacker News front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 37 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before. Hope you get to spend the next Christmas with your family! reply upvote pdevr 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to everyone. Being a non-Christian and it being Christmas time, I am sharing one verse from the New Testament that is, in my opinion, useful - or at the very least, insightful - to anyone, regardless of religion. Luke 16:10: He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. reply upvote tekacs 1 hour ago | | [–] Fun seeing HN restart to switch to the Christmas theme, in three steps: https://share.cleanshot.com/vJZv6k03 (restarting the server) https://share.cleanshot.com/qFyM347P (online but temporarily readonly) https://share.cleanshot.com/kW8kY7mp (back online!) reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | [–] You must have grabbed that first one awfully quickly! reply upvote andersa 1 hour ago | | | [–] So what's the christmas theme?

Jails have their own IP addresses and root filesystem, plus they use the host OS's version of libc and OpenSSL/LibreSSL and all the other core utils. Is it the convenience utilities for building and running container images? reply upvote dang 43 minutes ago | | | [–] I was joking. There is no container.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season.

I almost turned it off, oh no, christian stuff I thought. But she talked about her first Christmas without her mom. Then they played her song about it. If I had been 5 minutes more trying to sleep, or given up on sleep 5 minutes earlier, I would have missed that.

We are currently on an HN item/comments page (not the HN list). The task is to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the Hacker News listing page. A knowledge base function exists that directly accomplishes this by navigating to /news and clicking the appropriate comments/discuss link for the story at rank 3: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3). Since it will navigate away, it should be the last action.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

<reasoning>
We are currently on an HN item (comments) page, not the HN front-page list. The task is to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page (i.e., rank 3 on the HN front page). A knowledge_base function exists that directly performs exactly this: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank). It navigates to /news and clicks the comments/discuss link for the given rank. Using this function is required and is the most reliable approach. Since it will navigate away, it should be the last action in act().
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Open the comments/discussion thread for the 3rd item on the Hacker News front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I’m struck by honestly what a miracle it is that we can travel thousands of miles at hundreds of MPH and have okay internet access and communicate.

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December.

Stuck alone during COVID in 2021 in a really bad place. I couldn't sleep. And I happened to turn on the radio in the middle of the night and there was an Amy Grant interview. I almost turned it off, oh no, christian stuff I thought. But she talked about her first Christmas without her mom. Then they played her song about it. If I had been 5 minutes more trying to sleep, or given up on sleep 5 minutes earlier, I would have missed that.

<reasoning>
We’re currently on an HN item/comments page, not on the HN list page where “3rd item” (rank 3) makes sense. The knowledge base function `open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank)` exactly matches the required action: it navigates to `/news` and clicks the comments/discuss link for the story at the given 1-based rank. So we should call it with rank=3. This triggers navigation, so it must be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item (rank 3) on the HN front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time.

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

<reasoning>
We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page. We are currently on an HN item page, not the /news list where items have ranks. The knowledge_base function `open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank)` exactly matches this task: it navigates to `/news` (relative) and opens the comments/discuss link for the story at the given 1-based rank. Therefore we should call it with rank=3. This involves navigation, so it should be the last action in `act`.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread
    # for the 3rd item (rank 3) on the Hacker News front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

</code>

But it's Christmas here, so: Merry Christmas to everyone.

Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.

I’m struck by honestly what a miracle it is that we can travel thousands of miles at hundreds of MPH and have okay internet access and communicate. I don’t think people quite realise how delicate all of the technology is now and how easily it could fail if we don’t all look after each other.

Love seeing the custom HN theme every year. Sometimes after Christmas, I avoid refreshing an HN tab, so I get to see the theme just a little bit longer :) This year is a bit special to me. I recently moved countries for a new job, but I moved a bit too soon. Now I am spending the holiday season alone for the first time in my life.

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same.

My father and mother have departed.

But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

I check Hacker News every day and have learned an immense amount from all the commenters, articles, and discussions over the years. I thank you all for that. I am truly grateful. I wish you all a Merry Christmas full of joy, and I hope you can all appreciate, share, and express love for those around you, be it family, friends, or strangers on the internet. We are all very lucky to be part of the HN site and community. I have been here for about 15 years (at least that is what it feels like) with my other accounts that I don't want to dox. Glory to God.

Stuck alone during COVID in 2021 in a really bad place. I couldn't sleep. And I happened to turn on the radio in the middle of the night and there was an Amy Grant interview. I almost turned it off, oh no, christian stuff I thought. But she talked about her first Christmas without her mom. Then they played her song about it. If I had been 5 minutes more trying to sleep, or given up on sleep 5 minutes earlier, I would have missed that. Anyways, in case anyone needs to stumble upon something similar, I couldn't find something so perfect but... hearing it now it's not as amazing as it was that night I needed to not be alone in grief, but here it is: https://www.npr.org/2016/12/25/506715971/amy-grant-on-faith-... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LOqLV6Om4A Merry Christmas to you! reply upvote adventured 37 minutes ago | | [–] Merry Christmas HN reply upvote tory 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas :) reply upvote kevinmhickey 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas to all!! reply upvote arjonagelhout 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas!

<reasoning>
We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd item on the page. A knowledge-base function exists that directly performs this action for Hacker News by navigating to /news and opening the comments/discuss link for the given 1-based rank. Using that function is the most correct and is required when available. From the current item page, we can call it with rank=3; it will navigate away, so it must be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments/discussion thread
    # for the 3rd item (rank 3) on the Hacker News front page.
    await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=3)

I was a bit eager to start work after three months of waiting for the HSP 1b visa. Tried to keep myself busy with side projects, and got quite far with embedded Rust. But the lack of a \"regular schedule\" from a job was making me eager to start \"proper work\" again. So far, it has been a mixed bag of trade-offs. Made it in time for various events, got to see a few friends for the first time in a while, etc. However, nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. Probably obvious to everybody, but seriously do not schedule a move in December. If it is feasible, spend the time to make memories with your family and loved ones. reply upvote coffeemug 39 minutes ago | | | [–] > nothing beats the comfort and security of one's parents home, especially during the holiday season. A bit morbid, but reminds me of this passage by John Quincy Adams: > Everything about the house is the same. I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bedchamber [...] That moment was inexpressibly painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to my heart. My father and mother have departed. The charm which has always made this house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved; and yet my attachment to it, and to the whole region around, is stronger than I ever felt it before.

Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents.

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base).

Jails have their own IP addresses and root filesystem, plus they use the host OS's version of libc and OpenSSL/LibreSSL and all the other core utils. Is it the convenience utilities for building and running container images? reply upvote dang 45 minutes ago | | | [–] I was joking. There is no container. (We don't use jails either.) reply upvote jagged-chisel 1 hour ago | | | [–] Restart?! ouch reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] HN is a pretty simple, efficient monolithic web application. Some updates might need a restart. It's OK for some web requests to fail during that time. HN isn't life critical with sixtuple nine uptime requirements. reply upvote sallveburrpi 1 hour ago | | | [–] Tbh like 99% of web apps aren’t critical - most of them are for buying something or providing infrastructure to make it easier to buy something anyway. It’s fine if your online shop is down for a few minutes (of course the business won’t see it like that but it’s true) reply upvote basilikum 1 hour ago | | | [–] A sales site being down might lose you a sale. But the simplicity might save you so muh more than that loses you. And often the complexion of high availability infrastructure results in more downtime than it prevents. For stuff like HN, I like the peek behind the scenes it provides. It's all just software written by some humans and way too often people take themselves and their shitty software way too serious. reply upvote uyzstvqs 1 hour ago | | | | [–] It could probably be done with a simple if statement, but I'm guessing that dang enjoys the tradition of doing it manually every year. reply upvote lomase 1 hour ago | | | | [–] Steam, +130 million users, biggest gamming store, multi billion dolar company, is offline every week for a few minutes. 99.999999 is so overated. reply upvote dang 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I'd rather restart once (ok, twice) a year than keep that code around in production all the time. It only affects traffic for about 10 seconds. reply upvote kelnos 1 hour ago | | | | [–] I feel like this obsession with zero downtime has gotten a bit silly. Sure, for some things it's damn near required (though I imagine that's fewer things than most people think), but it 100% does not matter even a little bit if HN is unavailable for 10 seconds or so. reply upvote shredprez 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas, everyone!

MERKLE TREE H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 But that's a little too tidy to be a proper Christmas tree — so here’s a more “tree-like” version with ornaments, while still preserving the Merkle structure: H(ROOT) / \ H(0-1) H(2-3) / \ / \ H(0) H(1) H(2) H(3) / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) (leaf)(leaf)(leaf) Notes (so it’s actually Merkle-y) D0–D3 = data blocks (your “presents” ) H(0) = hash(D0 || D0) (duplicated leaf for balance, common in Merkle trees) H(0-1) = hash(H(0) || H(1)) H(ROOT) = hash(H(0-1) || H(2-3)) If you want, I can: generate a bigger tree (8, 16, 32 leaves), make the hashes look like real hash strings, or format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. -- Prompt: format it like a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette while keeping the Merkle parent/child layout. Answer: You got it — here’s a perfect triangular Christmas tree silhouette that still preserves the Merkle parent/child layout (parents directly above their two children, leaves at the base). H(ROOT) / \ ┌────────H(0-3)────────┐ / \ ┌────H(0-1)────┐ ┌────H(2-3)────┐ / \ / \ ┌─H(0)─┐ ┌─H(1)─┐ ┌─H(2)─┐ ┌─H(3)─┐ / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 If you want it even more like a Christmas tree (full silhouette + ornaments) Here’s a slightly more “filled” version while keeping the structure valid: H(ROOT) / \ ──────H(0-3)────── / \ ─────H(0-1)───── ─────H(2-3)───── / \ / \ ───H(0)─── ───H(1)─── ───H(2)─── ───H(3)─── / \ / \ / \ / \ D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 Edit: Note the emoji ornaments did not come through. reply upvote BewareTheYiga 1 hour ago | | [–] * /*\ /***\ /*****\ /*******\ /*********\ /*** * ***\ /*************\ /*** * * ****\ /*****************\ /*** * * * *****\ /*********************\ /********** *** ********\ ||| ||| ||| Merry Christmas, HN reply upvote jimnotgym 1 hour ago | | [–] Merry Christmas everyone.
