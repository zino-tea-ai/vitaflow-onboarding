We need to get news titles from the Hacker News front page. No knowledge_base functions are available (function list empty), so we'll use Playwright directly. From the accessibility tree, each story row contains a cell with the story title as a link (e.g., link "Maybe the default settings are too high"). We'll collect all such title links within the main stories table by locating rows that include an "upvote" cell and then selecting the title link in the third cell; simplest robust way: select all links whose URL is external (starts with http) within the main table and extract their accessible names. Return/print results as-is (list of strings).
</reasoning>

<code>
import re

async def act(page):
    # Collect all external story title links on the front page.
    # On HN, story title links point to absolute http(s) URLs, while other links are relative (item, user, from, vote, etc.).
    title_links = page.get_by_role("link").filter(has_not=page.get_by_role("img"))

    # Evaluate in page context to extract accessible names for links whose href starts with http.
    titles = await page.evaluate("""() => {
        const anchors = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a'));
        const out = [];
        for (const a of anchors) {
          const href = a.getAttribute('href') || '';
          if (/^https?:\/\//i.test(href)) {
            const text = (a.textContent || '').trim();
            // Heuristic: story titles are non-empty and not site links like 'example.com'
            if (text && !/^\w[\w.-]*\.[a-z]{2,}(?:\/[\S]*)?$/i.test(text)) {
              out.push(text);
            }
          }
        }
        return out;
    }""")

    print(titles)
    return titles

<reasoning>
No knowledge_base functions are available (function list is empty), so Playwright must be used directly.
The task is “获取新闻标题” (get the news titles). We are already on the Hacker News front page and titles are present as link elements inside the stories table.
To be exceptionally correct and avoid ambiguous selectors, scope to the main stories table, then select rows that correspond to story title rows (they contain an “upvote” link). From each such row, take the first link in the title cell that is not the “upvote” link and not the site link.
Return the extracted titles as a list, printing and returning exactly what is retrieved.

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Scope to the main content table that contains the list of stories.

    # Story title rows are identifiable by containing an "upvote" link.
    story_rows = main_table.get_by_role("row").filter(
        has=page.get_by_role("link", name="upvote")

<reasoning>
Knowledge base functions: none are available (empty list), so we must use Playwright directly.
We need to 获取新闻标题 (get the news titles) from the current Hacker News front page.
The previous attempt filtering rows by has=page.get_by_role("link", name="upvote") failed likely due to scoping mismatch; instead, we can reliably extract titles by evaluating the DOM: select the story title anchors (HN uses `a.storylink` / `a.titlelink` depending on version). As a robust fallback, also consider `span.titleline > a`.
We will return the list of titles exactly as retrieved (no additional processing beyond selecting the title anchors and mapping to textContent).
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    titles = await page.evaluate("""() => {
      const selectors = ['span.titleline > a', 'a.storylink', 'a.titlelink'];
      let anchors = [];
      for (const sel of selectors) {
        anchors = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(sel));
        if (anchors.length) break;
      }
      return anchors.map(a => (a.textContent || '').trim());
    }""")

    print(titles)
    return titles
