You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is \u83b7\u53d6\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Hacker News', with the url 'https://news.ycombinator.com/'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nWe need to get the news titles from the Hacker News front page. No knowledge_base functions are available. Using the accessibility tree, each story row contains a cell with a link whose name is the title. We can collect all such title links by anchoring within the main table -> rowgroup, then locating links that match a pattern like \" (\" in their accessible name (titles include the site in parentheses in the cell name, but the link itself is just the title). Safer: directly target the title links we can enumerate by taking the first story title link and then using a locator for all links inside the stories table that are followed by a site link; however we must keep it simple. We'll select all links in the story list table excluding navigation/footer by scoping to the big content rowgroup and filtering out known nav link names. But we must not process/filter/transform results; however collecting all_inner_texts is fine. We'll use get_by_role chaining: document->table->rowgroup->row (the big row containing stories) -> cell -> table -> rowgroup. Then within that rowgroup, get_by_role('link') and use .evaluate_all to extract text? That would be processing. Better: use .all_inner_texts() which returns list of strings as-is. We'll then print and return it.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def act(page):\n    # Scope to the main stories list (the large table under the header)\n    stories_rowgroup = (\n        page.get_by_role(\"document\", name=\"Hacker News\")\n        .get_by_role(\"table\")\n        .get_by_role(\"rowgroup\")\n        .get_by_role(\n            \"row\",\n            name=\"1. upvote Maybe the default settings are too high\",\n        )\n        .get_by_role(\"cell\")\n        .get_by_role(\"table\")\n        .get_by_role(\"rowgroup\")\n    )\n\n    # Collect all link texts within the stories list rowgroup\n    all_link_texts = await stories_rowgroup.get_by_role(\"link\").all_inner_texts()\n\n    print(all_link_texts)\n    return all_link_texts\n\n</code>\n\n<stdout>\n[]\n\n</stdout>\n\n<result>\n[]\n</result>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nNo knowledge_base functions are available (functions list is empty), so we must use Playwright locators directly.\nWe need to \u83b7\u53d6\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898 (get the news titles) from the Hacker News front page.\nFrom the accessibility tree, each story title is a link inside the story rows like: row \"1. upvote ...\" -> cell \"<title> (site)\" -> link \"<title>\".

More\") inside the outer table->rowgroup. Inside that row\u2019s single cell is an inner table->rowgroup that contains repeating story title rows.\nEach story title row has: cell with rank, cell with an \"upvote\" link, and then a title cell containing a link whose name is the story title (plus a second link for the domain). So we can:\n1) Locate that big container row by role=row and name substring \"More\" (unique on the page per tree).\n2) Enter its cell -> inner table -> rowgroup.\n3) Select all rows that have a child link named \"upvote\" (filters to title rows only).\n4) Within those rows, select the title link by excluding the \"upvote\" link and excluding the domain link (domain links contain a dot like \"raptitude.com\"). We can do this by: row.get_by_role('link').filter(has_not=...upvote...).filter(has_not=...link name=\".\" exact=False...) .first, but `all_inner_texts()` requires a locator over all elements; easiest is to take all links in those rows and then use `evaluate_all` to return their text content for only those that are not 'upvote' and not containing '.'? However policy says no processing/transform of API results; using evaluate_all with filtering would be processing.\nSo instead, use the stable structure: in each title row, the third cell (title cell) contains the first link = title. We can directly select: title_rows.get_by_role('cell').nth(2).get_by_role('link').first, but nth(2) over all cells across all rows won\u2019t map per-row.\nBetter: use a locator that targets the title link by URL pattern: story title links are external https://..., while upvote is \"vote?how=up...\" and domain links are \"from?site=...\" (relative). We can select links within story rows whose url starts with \"https://\". Playwright supports `get_by_role(..., url=...)` with regex.

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\nIMPORTANT: If a knowledge_base function performs the exact action required by the task (e.g., navigating to a specific page, opening a comments thread), and the page state after execution shows the task is complete (e.g., you are now on the target page), you should TERMINATE immediately by leaving python_code blank and setting terminate_with_result to indicate success. Do NOT call the same function repeatedly if the task is already accomplished.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n",
