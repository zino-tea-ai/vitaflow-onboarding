<reasoning>
We need to get news titles from the Hacker News front page. No knowledge_base functions are available (empty), so we will use Playwright locators. In the accessibility tree, each story title is a link inside the third cell of each story row (e.g., row name contains "1. upvote ..."). We'll collect all such rows in the list table and extract the first link text from the title cell. We'll return/print the list of titles as-is (no filtering/processing beyond retrieving text).
</reasoning>

<code>
import asyncio

async def act(page):
    # On Hacker News front page; extract visible story title links.
    # Each story is in a row whose accessible name starts with "N. upvote ...".
    story_rows = page.get_by_role(
        "row",
        name=". upvote",
    )

    titles = []
    count = await story_rows.count()
    for i in range(count):
        row = story_rows.nth(i)
        # The title is the first link in the third cell of the story row.
        title_link = row.get_by_role("cell").nth(2).get_by_role("link").first
        titles.append(await title_link.inner_text())

    print(titles)
    return titles
