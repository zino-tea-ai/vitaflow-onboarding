<reasoning>
We need to get news titles from the current Hacker News front page. No knowledge_base functions are available (empty), so we will use Playwright directly. The accessibility tree shows each story as a table row containing a cell with a link whose accessible name is the title. We can locate the main stories table (the innermost table under the big cell) and then query all title links. On HN, the title links have class 'titleline' anchors, but we should rely on roles: get all links within the stories table and exclude known non-title links like 'upvote', domain links, user links, time links, hide, comments. However instruction says if API returns info, return as-is without processing. We'll instead use page.eval_on_selector_all to return textContent of 'span.titleline > a' which is straightforward and returns list of titles as-is. Then print and return that list.
</reasoning>

<code>
import asyncio

async def act(page):
    # Extract all story titles from the Hacker News front page.
    titles = await page.eval_on_selector_all(
        "span.titleline > a",
        "els => els.map(e => e.textContent)"
    )
    print(titles)
    return titles
