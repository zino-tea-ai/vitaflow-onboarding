You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Open the comments page for the 5th story on this page.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Asterisk AI Voice Agent | Hacker News', with the url 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46380399'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n# Skill: async def open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank: int)\nOpen the Hacker News comments thread (HN \"item\" page) for the front-page story at a given rank.\n\nThis skill navigates to the Hacker News front page (`/news`) and clicks the\ncomments/discuss link for the story currently displayed at 1-based rank `rank`.\n\nHow it works (observed HN page structure)\n----------------------------------------\n- The `/news` page is a table where each story is represented by a *title row*\n  (rank number + \"upvote\" + title), followed shortly by a *subtext row*\n  containing points/user/age and a link to the comments thread.\n- The link to the comment thread is typically either:\n    - \"<number> comments\" (e.g., \"192 comments\"), or\n    - \"discuss\" (often used when there are 0 comments).\n\nSelector strategy (Accessibility Tree-centric; no CSS/xpath locators)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Row accessible names include volatile content (points, username, age, comment count),\n  so matching a row by its full accessible name is brittle.\n- Instead, this function:\n    1) enumerates all rows via `page.get_by_role(\"row\")`\n    2) treats rows containing a link named \"upvote\" as *title rows*\n    3) picks the (rank-1)th title row\n    4) scans forward a handful of subsequent rows to find the first comments link\n       (either a \"<number> comments\" link or a \"discuss\" link) and clicks it.\n\nUnexpected-but-useful observations\n---------------------------------\n- Hacker News frequently inserts spacer rows between a title row and its subtext row.\n  Because of that, assuming \"the very next row is the subtext row\" can be flaky.\n  Scanning forward for the comments/discuss link is more robust.\n- The heuristic \"row contains an 'upvote' link\" should work for typical `/news` stories,\n  but may fail in edge cases (e.g., unusual items or different logged-in behavior).\n  If that occurs, the heuristic may need to be changed to detect title rows by the\n  presence of the story title link instead.\n\nParameters\n----------\npage:\n    Playwright page.\nrank:\n    1-based rank on `/news` (e.g., 12 for the 12th story).\n\nReturns\n-------\nstr\n    A confirmation message indicating the task was completed successfully.\n    This helps the AI agent know when to terminate.\n\nRaises\n------\nValueError\n    If `rank` < 1, if the rank is not present on the page, or if the comments/discuss\n    link cannot be found after the selected title row.\n\nUsage log\n---------\n- 2025-12-25: Opened the rank-12 story comments by clicking the \"192 comments\" link.\n  Result: navigated to the HN item page (comments thread) successfully.\n\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nWe need to open the comments page for the 5th story on the Hacker News front page. A knowledge_base function exists that performs exactly this: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank). Using it is required and more robust than crafting our own selectors. We'll call it with rank=5; it will ensure we're on /news and click the corresponding comments/discuss link, navigating to the item (comments) page. That click triggers navigation, so it should be the last meaningful action; we can return/print the function's confirmation string.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments thread for the 5th story.\n    result = await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=5)\n    print(result)\n\n</code>\n\n<stdout>\nSUCCESS: Opened comments page for story #5.

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\nIMPORTANT: If a knowledge_base function performs the exact action required by the task (e.g., navigating to a specific page, opening a comments thread), and the page state after execution shows the task is complete (e.g., you are now on the target page), you should TERMINATE immediately by leaving python_code blank and setting terminate_with_result to indicate success. Do NOT call the same function repeatedly if the task is already accomplished.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n"
