Looking at the accessibility tree, I don't see a direct 'search' link on the Hacker News homepage. The HN Search feature is typically accessed via hn.algolia.com or by going to the search functionality. I should look for a search link or navigate to the search page. Let me scroll down to see if there's a search link at the bottom, or I can navigate directly to hn.algolia.com which is the official HN search.",

  "prompt": "You generate Playwright code to interact with websites.\n\n## CRITICAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW - violations cause errors):\n\n### 1. SELECTOR RULES - Avoid \"strict mode violation\"\n- ALWAYS add `.first` after `get_by_role()` to avoid matching multiple elements\n- Example: `page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Submit\").first.click()` \u2705\n- NOT: `page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Submit\").click()` \u274c\n\n### 2. TIMEOUT RULES - Avoid \"TimeoutError\"\n- ALWAYS use `timeout=15000` for click(), fill(), press() operations\n- Example: `await element.first.click(timeout=15000)` \u2705\n- Before interacting, wait for element: `await page.wait_for_selector(\"selector\", state=\"visible\", timeout=15000)`\n\n### 3. CHARACTER RULES - Avoid \"Non-UTF-8\" errors\n- NEVER use non-ASCII characters in code (no Chinese, no emojis, no special symbols)\n- Comments and strings must be in English only\n\n### 4. URL RULES - Avoid \"invalid URL\" errors\n- ALWAYS validate URL starts with http:// or https:// before goto()\n- Prefer relative paths: `await page.goto(\"/search\")` instead of full URLs\n\n## General Guidelines:\n - If you want to click a generic button (e.g. that belongs to an element), use the full `.get_by_role()` path to\n   the element (e.g. .get_by_role(\"group\", name=\"Test Item\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\").first\n   instead of .get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\"), as this is ambiguous)\n - Write exceptionally *correct* Python code.\n - You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge_base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Click on the search/hn search link, search for 'AI', and return the title of the first search result..\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Hacker News', with the url 'https://news.ycombinator.com/'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. Because you are on the first step, please use your existing knowledge of the website to create an overall plan for how to achieve the task.\nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"Hacker News\" {\n  table {\n    rowgroup {\n      row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n        cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n          table {\n            rowgroup {\n              row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n                cell {\n                  link, url: \"\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit\" {\n                  link: \"Hacker News\", url: \"news\";\n                  link: \"new\", url: \"newest\";\n                  link: \"past\", url: \"front\";\n                  link: \"comments\", url: \"newcomments\";\n                  link: \"ask\", url: \"ask\";\n                  link: \"show\", url: \"show\";\n                  link: \"jobs\", url: \"jobs\";\n                  link: \"submit\", url: \"submit\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"login\" {\n                  link: \"login\", url: \"login?goto=news\";\n                };\n              };\n            };\n          };\n        };\n      };\n\n      row;\n      row: \"1. upvote Maybe the default settings are too high (raptitude.com) 174 points by htk 2 hours ago | hide | 51 comments 2. upvote MiniMax M2.1: Built for Real-World Complex Tasks, Multi-Language Programming (minimaxi.com) 27 points by 110 47 minutes ago | hide | 2 comments 3. upvote Python 3.15\u2019s interpreter for Windows x86-64 should hopefully be 15% faster (fidget-spinner.github.io) 321 points by lumpa 12 hours ago | hide | 104 comments 4. upvote Fahrplan \u2013 39C3 (ccc.de) 133 points by rurban 7 hours ago | hide | 15 comments 5. upvote The entire New Yorker archive is now digitized (newyorker.com) 334 points by thm 13 hours ago | hide | 50 comments 6. upvote Paperbacks and TikTok (calnewport.com) 56 points by zdw 4 hours ago | hide | 31 comments 7. upvote CUDA Tile Open Sourced (github.com/nvidia) 142 points by JonChesterfield 9 hours ago | hide | 42 comments 8. upvote Archiving Git branches as tags (octavore.com) 82 points by octavore 7 hours ago | hide | 22 comments 9. upvote Asahi Linux with Sway on the MacBook Air M2 (2024) (lawrence.lu) 182 points by andsoitis 11 hours ago | hide | 160 comments 10. upvote The Program 2025 annual review: How much money does an audio drama podcast make?

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\n## TERMINATION RULES (CRITICAL - avoid infinite loops):\n\n1. **Check if task is ALREADY COMPLETE** before generating code:\n   - Look at the current page state (title, URL, content)\n   - If the task goal is achieved, TERMINATE immediately\n   \n2. **After using a knowledge_base function**:\n   - If the function performed the exact action required \u2192 TERMINATE\n   - Do NOT call the same function again\n   - Do NOT generate redundant navigation code\n\n3. **How to TERMINATE**:\n   - Leave `python_code` field BLANK (empty string)\n   - Set `terminate_with_result` to describe what was accomplished\n   - Example: `terminate_with_result: \"Successfully navigated to the comments page for the top story\"`\n\n4. **Signs you should TERMINATE**:\n   - You already navigated to the target page\n   - The information requested is visible on screen\n   - A previous action already completed the task\n   - You've been on the same page for multiple steps without progress\n\nIMPORTANT: If a knowledge_base function performs the exact action required by the task (e.g., navigating to a specific page, opening a comments thread), and the page state after execution shows the task is complete (e.g., you are now on the target page), you should TERMINATE immediately by leaving python_code blank and setting terminate_with_result to indicate success. Do NOT call the same function repeatedly if the task is already accomplished.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n",
