<reasoning>
We need to open the comments/discussion for the 3rd post on the listing. From the accessibility tree under main, posts appear sequentially with a title link and a comments link (e.g., "8 comments", then ad, then "144 comments", then "39 comments" etc.). The 3rd post is "Fifty problems with standard web APIs in 2025" and its comments link is "39 comments". No knowledge_base functions are available (functions list is empty), so we directly click the specific comments link. Since navigation will occur, make this the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # 3rd post on the page: "Fifty problems with standard web APIs in 2025"
    # Open its comments/discussion by clicking the "39 comments" link.
    await page.get_by_role("main").get_by_role("link", name="39 comments").click()

</code>
