<reasoning>
We need to search Hacker News for 'AI startup' and view results. A knowledge_base function exists: hn_search_from_footer(page, query, start_path) which navigates to /news, scrolls to footer, fills the footer search textbox, presses Enter, and waits for results. This exactly matches the required action and is preferred over manual selectors. We are already on HN front page, but the function will ensure correct starting page. After it runs, we should be on results page (HN/Algolia) viewing results; no further actions required.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to perform the footer search and navigate to results.
    await hn_search_from_footer(page, query="AI startup", start_path="https://news.ycombinator.com/news")

</code>
