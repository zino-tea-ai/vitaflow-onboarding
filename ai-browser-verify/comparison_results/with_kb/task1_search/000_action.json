  "step_by_step_reasoning": "We need to search Hacker News for 'rust programming' using the footer search box. A knowledge_base function `hn_search_from_footer(page, query, start_path=...)` exactly performs this: it navigates to an HN listing page, scrolls to bottom, fills the footer search textbox, presses Enter, and waits for results. Since we are already on the HN front page, we can still use it; it will ensure correct footer interaction and avoid ambiguous selectors. We'll call it with query='rust programming' and a start_path on-site; use the default or explicitly pass current listing page URL. After it runs, the search results page should load, completing the task.",
  "python_code": "async def act(page):\n    # Use the provided knowledge_base skill to search via the footer search box.\n    await hn_search_from_footer(page, query=\"rust programming\", start_path=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/news\")\n",
  "terminate_with_result": "",
  "prompt": "You generate Playwright code to interact with websites.\n - If you want to click a generic button (e.g. that belongs to an element), use the full `.get_by_role()` path to\n   the element (e.g. .get_by_role(\"group\", name=\"Test Item\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\")\n   instead of .get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\"), as this is ambiguous)\n - Write exceptionally *correct* Python code.\n - You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge_base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Search Hacker News for 'rust programming' using the footer search box.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'Hacker News', with the url 'https://news.ycombinator.com/'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n# Skill: async def hn_search_from_footer(page, query: str, start_path: str = \"https://news.ycombinator.com/news\")\nSearch Hacker News using the footer \"Search\" textbox.\n\nWhat this skill does:\n    1) Navigates to a Hacker News listing page (default: /news).\n    2) Scrolls to the bottom to reveal the footer area.\n    3) Finds the footer search textbox.\n    4) Fills it with ``query``.\n    5) Presses Enter to submit and waits for the results to load.\n\nArgs:\n    page: Playwright Page.\n    query: Search terms to submit (example: \"zig x server\").\n    start_path: Full URL to start from (example: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/news\").\n\nWaiting / navigation behavior:\n    - After pressing Enter, this function waits for ``domcontentloaded``.\n    - Depending on current HN configuration, submitting the footer search may:\n        * Navigate to an on-site results page, or\n        * Redirect to an external provider (commonly Algolia).\n      This skill does not assume a specific destination; it only waits for the next page\n      to reach DOMContentLoaded.\n\nSelector strategy and robustness notes:\n    - Hacker News pages are very minimal; the footer search input is typically the last\n      textbox on the page.\n    - This skill selects the last textbox (``page.get_by_role('textbox').last``) after\n      scrolling to the bottom. If a browser extension injects extra inputs at the end of the\n      page, this heuristic could select the wrong textbox.\n\nUnexpected/useful observed behavior:\n    - Scrolling to ``document.body.scrollHeight`` reliably reveals the footer search area.\n    - The search box can be used without clicking first; ``fill()`` + ``press('Enter')`` works.\n\nUsage log:\n    - 2025-12-25: From the HN front page listing, scrolled to footer, filled \"zig x server\",\n      pressed Enter; results page loaded successfully.\n\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. Because you are on the first step, please use your existing knowledge of the website to create an overall plan for how to achieve the task.\nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"Hacker News\" {\n  table {\n    rowgroup {\n      row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n        cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n          table {\n            rowgroup {\n              row: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\" {\n                cell {\n                  link, url: \"\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit\" {\n                  link: \"Hacker News\", url: \"news\";\n                  link: \"new\", url: \"newest\";\n                  link: \"past\", url: \"front\";\n                  link: \"comments\", url: \"newcomments\";\n                  link: \"ask\", url: \"ask\";\n                  link: \"show\", url: \"show\";\n                  link: \"jobs\", url: \"jobs\";\n                  link: \"submit\", url: \"submit\";\n                };\n\n                cell: \"login\" {\n                  link: \"login\", url: \"login?goto=news\";\n                };\n              };\n            };\n          };\n        };\n      };\n\n      row;\n      row: \"1. upvote Phoenix: A modern X server written from scratch in Zig (dec05eba.com) 152 points by snvzz 2 hours ago | hide | 51 comments 2. upvote Tell HN: Merry Christmas 302 points by basilikum 1 hour ago | hide | 100 comments 3. upvote Microsoft please get your tab to autocomplete shit together (ivanca.github.io) 50 points by AmbroseBierce 1 hour ago | hide | 13 comments 4. upvote Show HN: Minimalist editor that lives in browser, stores everything in the URL (github.com/antonmedv) 220 points by medv 5 hours ago | hide | 80 comments 5. upvote Who Watches the Waymos?

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n",
