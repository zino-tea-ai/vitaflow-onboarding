<reasoning>
We are on DuckDuckGo homepage with the main search box exposed as a combobox inside the Searchbox search region. To perform a search, we should focus the combobox, type the user-provided query, then submit via Enter (or enable and click the Search button). Since the prompt did not include the actual query string, the next step is to request it; we cannot proceed without it.

<code>
async def act(page):
    # The task requires searching DuckDuckGo, but no query string was provided.
    # No safe action to take without the query.
    return
