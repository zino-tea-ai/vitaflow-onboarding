<reasoning>
We need to open the comments page for the 5th story on the Hacker News front page. A knowledge_base function exists that performs exactly this: open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank). Using it avoids brittle selectors and already handles scanning for the comments/discuss link. We are currently on the HN front page, but the function will navigate to /news and click the rank-5 comments link; the click will navigate away, so it should be the last action.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Use the knowledge base skill to open the comments thread for the 5th ranked story.
    result = await open_hn_comments_thread_by_rank(page, rank=5)
    print(result)

</code>

<stdout>
SUCCESS: Opened comments page for story #5. Task complete.

</stdout>

<result>
'SUCCESS: Opened comments page for story #5. Task complete.'

I haven't tried any voice AI stuff yet but a 3s latency waiting on a reply seems rage inducing if you're actually trying to accomplish something. Is that really where SOTA is right now? reply upvote coderintherye 13 minutes ago | | [–] Microsoft Foundry's realtime voice API (which itself is wrapping AI models from the major players) has response times in the milliseconds. reply upvote wellthisisgreat 29 minutes ago | | | [–] No, there are models with sub-second latency for sure reply upvote eugene3306 23 minutes ago | | [–] I've created Asterisk Codex Skill, but turns out there is ten seconds timeout for scripts reply upvote looneysquash 25 minutes ago | | [–] That seems like bad news for Allison. Though I know she already had some TTS voices available, so many not. reply upvote aftbit 57 minutes ago | | [–] This opens up new possibilities for interactive phone services. Retro-futuristic for sure. reply upvote nextworddev 2 hours ago | | [–] Can I connect this to Twilio reply upvote kwindla 48 minutes ago | | [–] One easy way to build voice agents and connect them to Twilio is the Pipecat open source framework. Pipecat supports a wide variety of network transports, including the Twilio MediaStream WebSocket protocol so you don't have to bounce through a SIP server. Here's a getting started doc.[1] (If you do need SIP, this Asterisk project looks really great.) Pipecat has 90 or so integrations with all the models/services people use for voice AI these days.

In your opinion, how close is Pipecat + OSS to replacing proprietary infra from Vapi, Retell, Sierra, etc? reply upvote VladVladikoff 1 hour ago | | | [–] Technically yes, twilio has sip trunks. reply upvote krater23 2 hours ago | | [–] Please don't. I had a talk with a shitty AI bot on a Fedex line. It's absolute crap. Just give me a 'Type 1 for x, type 2 for y'. Then I don't need to guess what are the possibilities. reply upvote EvanAnderson 1 hour ago | | [–] Voice-controlled phone systems are hugely rage-inducing for me. I am often in loud setting with background chatter. Muting my audio and using a touchtone keypad is so much more accurate and easy than having to find a quiet place and worrying that somebody is going to say something that the voice response system detects. reply upvote 9x39 1 hour ago | | | [–] One problem is once you’re in deep building a phone IVR workflow beyond X or Y (yes, these are intentional), callers don’t care about some deep and featured input menu. They just mash 0 or pick a random option and demand a human finish the job and transfer them - understandably. When you’re committed to phone intent complexity (hell), the AI assisted options are sort of less bad since you don’t have to explain the menu to callers, they just make demands. reply upvote tartoran 34 minutes ago | | | [–] What if the goal is to keep gaslighting you until you give up your demands? reply upvote 9x39 20 minutes ago | | | [–] Most voice agents for large companies are a calculated game to deter customers from expensive humans as we know, but not always. Sort of like how Jira can be a streamlined tool or a prison of 50-step workflows, it's all up to the designer. reply upvote johnebgd 2 hours ago | [–] I welcome the spam calls from our asterisk overlords. reply upvote VladVladikoff 1 hour ago | [–] I’m honestly surprised it hasn’t been more prevalent yet. I still get call centre type spam calls where you can hear all the background noise of the rest of the call centre. reply upvote userbinator 44 minutes ago | | [–] Is the background noise real, or is it also AI-generated to make you think that it's a human? reply upvote tartoran 31 minutes ago | | [–] The background noise is a recording for sure, no AI needed, just a background noise audiofile in a loop would do. reply upvote VladVladikoff 20 minutes ago | | [–] Why though? It adds nothing positive, it only makes me sure it is a scam call. reply" {

Retro-futuristic for sure. reply upvote nextworddev 2 hours ago | | [–] Can I connect this to Twilio reply upvote kwindla 48 minutes ago | | [–] One easy way to build voice agents and connect them to Twilio is the Pipecat open source framework. Pipecat supports a wide variety of network transports, including the Twilio MediaStream WebSocket protocol so you don't have to bounce through a SIP server. Here's a getting started doc.[1] (If you do need SIP, this Asterisk project looks really great.) Pipecat has 90 or so integrations with all the models/services people use for voice AI these days. NVIDIA, AWS, all the foundation labs, all the voice AI labs, most of the video AI labs, and lots of other people use/contribute to Pipecat.

Retro-futuristic for sure. reply upvote nextworddev 2 hours ago | | [–] Can I connect this to Twilio reply upvote kwindla 48 minutes ago | | [–] One easy way to build voice agents and connect them to Twilio is the Pipecat open source framework. Pipecat supports a wide variety of network transports, including the Twilio MediaStream WebSocket protocol so you don't have to bounce through a SIP server. Here's a getting started doc.[1] (If you do need SIP, this Asterisk project looks really great.) Pipecat has 90 or so integrations with all the models/services people use for voice AI these days. NVIDIA, AWS, all the foundation labs, all the voice AI labs, most of the video AI labs, and lots of other people use/contribute to Pipecat. And there's lots of interesting stuff in the ecosystem, like the open source, open data, open training code Smart Turn audio turn detection model [2], and the Pipecat Flows state machine library [3].

In your opinion, how close is Pipecat + OSS to replacing proprietary infra from Vapi, Retell, Sierra, etc? reply upvote VladVladikoff 1 hour ago | | | [–] Technically yes, twilio has sip trunks. reply upvote krater23 2 hours ago | | [–] Please don't. I had a talk with a shitty AI bot on a Fedex line. It's absolute crap. Just give me a 'Type 1 for x, type 2 for y'. Then I don't need to guess what are the possibilities. reply upvote EvanAnderson 1 hour ago | | [–] Voice-controlled phone systems are hugely rage-inducing for me. I am often in loud setting with background chatter. Muting my audio and using a touchtone keypad is so much more accurate and easy than having to find a quiet place and worrying that somebody is going to say something that the voice response system detects. reply upvote 9x39 1 hour ago | | | [–] One problem is once you’re in deep building a phone IVR workflow beyond X or Y (yes, these are intentional), callers don’t care about some deep and featured input menu. They just mash 0 or pick a random option and demand a human finish the job and transfer them - understandably. When you’re committed to phone intent complexity (hell), the AI assisted options are sort of less bad since you don’t have to explain the menu to callers, they just make demands. reply upvote tartoran 34 minutes ago | | | [–] What if the goal is to keep gaslighting you until you give up your demands? reply upvote 9x39 20 minutes ago | | | [–] Most voice agents for large companies are a calculated game to deter customers from expensive humans as we know, but not always. Sort of like how Jira can be a streamlined tool or a prison of 50-step workflows, it's all up to the designer. reply upvote johnebgd 2 hours ago | [–] I welcome the spam calls from our asterisk overlords. reply upvote VladVladikoff 1 hour ago | [–] I’m honestly surprised it hasn’t been more prevalent yet. I still get call centre type spam calls where you can hear all the background noise of the rest of the call centre. reply upvote userbinator 44 minutes ago | | [–] Is the background noise real, or is it also AI-generated to make you think that it's a human? reply upvote tartoran 31 minutes ago | | [–] The background noise is a recording for sure, no AI needed, just a background noise audiofile in a loop would do. reply upvote VladVladikoff 20 minutes ago | | [–] Why though?
