Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 4 hours ago | | [\u2013] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail.
