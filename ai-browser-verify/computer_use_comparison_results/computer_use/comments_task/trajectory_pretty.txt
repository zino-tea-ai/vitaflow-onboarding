<reasoning>
We need the comments page for the 5th story on the Hacker News front page. The accessibility tree shows the 5th item row and its metadata row containing a link named "87 comments" with url "item". Clicking that link should open the comments (item) page. No knowledge_base functions are available (empty), so we directly use Playwright. To avoid ambiguous selectors, we scope the click through the specific row for the 5th story, then the following row that contains the comments link, but in the tree each story has a separate row for title and a row for subtext. The comments link is in the subtext row whose accessible name includes "249 points by medv... | 87 comments". We'll locate that row by role "row" and name substring including "249 points by medv" and then click its "87 comments" link. Navigation expected, so last action is the click.
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    # Click the comments link for the 5th story ("... | 87 comments")
    await page.get_by_role(
        "row",
        name="249 points by medv 7 hours ago | hide | 87 comments",
    ).get_by_role("link", name="87 comments").click()

</code>

What it does: Single HTML file, no deps, 111 loc Notes live in the URL hash (shareable links!) Auto-compressed with CompressionStream Plain-text editor (contenteditable) History support Page title from first # heading Respects light/dark mode No storage, cookies, or tracking The entire app is the page source. https://textarea.my/ add comment upvote gnyman 5 hours ago | [–] Funny how I made almost exactly the same but for maps. I needed a way to share a link to a map, with drawings and the ability for the receiver to see their own location on the map. Annotated screenshots solves the first but not the second. Vibe engineered this, with many of the same ideas as OP. Took an evening. Just in time apps for one specific use case is a thing. And because it's so cheap to make and can be hosted cheaply with no backend, it can be given away for free. https://nyman.re/mapdraw/#l=60.172108%2C24.941458&z=16&d=LU8... reply upvote mathgeek 4 hours ago | | [–] > Vibe engineered While I'm all for vibe coding as appropriate, there's a lot of humor to be found it calling it engineering. :D reply upvote block_dagger 4 hours ago | | | [–] Fair.

Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 4 hours ago | | [–] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail.

I did not use the URL, did not have double the fun, and now I’m sad. https://github.com/codazoda/ponder reply upvote wwarren 7 hours ago | | [–] Amazing. The crime and punishment example crashed my iPhone’s Google Chrome when I tap the URL haha reply upvote planb 5 hours ago | | [–] A few weeks ago I vibe coded a guitar tab editor just because I wanted to share a quick tab in a chat group with my band. When the first prototype already worked great, I just couldn’t stop to add features so that it now even has mouseover chord diagrams and copy and paste. The sharing works just like here, by encoding the tab itself in the url. https://github.com/planbnet/guitartabs reply upvote urbandw311er 2 hours ago | | [–] Neat. But why would you auto-set the title from markdown heading syntax when it doesn’t support markdown? (Or any rich text in fact) reply upvote marcuskaz 6 hours ago | | [–] I have a similar one using localStorage https://github.com/mkaz/browser-pad reply upvote spacedoutman 2 hours ago | | [–] Seems like we have all built something similar. hopefully mine can stand out with all the extra features i have managed to cram in reply upvote ljlolel 6 hours ago | | [–] I love this. Now if you bootstrap the app code into the url too then you can have a minimal kernel to run any machine in url. Then you can also make a Quine somehow. reply upvote mixedmath 4 hours ago | | [–] I wrote a similar app when mathbin was shutting down. It allows about 1500 characters of mathjax-displayed notes.

I tried a similar content-in-url approach for a family grocery list app but I couldn't get the url that short. (It worked but it was a bit cumbersome sharing over Whatsapp.) Will see what I can learn from this! reply upvote gisho 5 hours ago | | [–] I created a similar app just 2 days ago targeting Whatsapp (https://linqshare.com) . Context: In my locality, EA, we normally have Whatsapp groups raising funds for whatever reason; for every content edit, the admin has to copy-edit-paste updated content(which contains name and amount) to the group. This small app intends to provide a table that's easy to convey this info. App stores content in the url but a preview image (needed for Whatsapp share) is stored at R2.

It's less about the limits of a URL and more about practicality. I also have no way to confirm that URLs aren't logged server side, so I'd never trust the claim about \"no tracking\". That's why these projects also end up self-hosted. reply upvote denisinvader 6 hours ago | [–] hash part of url only available in the browser, as far as I know, server doesn’t have access to # value reply upvote jamesdwilson 5 hours ago | | | [–] very easy for the server to intentionally (or by compromise) add a one liner to send the hash text up. reply upvote sublinear 6 hours ago | | | [–] Typos and URL mangles are common though, and I'd still have no way to confirm if it got logged in that case. It's out of scope for anything in the github source, and instead depends on the server hosting the page. I know this isn't meant to be super secure, but it's still worth a mention. reply upvote throwaway150 5 hours ago | | [–] Typos aren't making the hash part turn into something else. Like your parent comment explained to you, the hash part is not sent to the server. If you go out of your way to mangle the URL then of course a mangled URL without hash will likely get logged to the server. But I'm not sure how one would manage to go so much out of the way that they mangle the URL in a way that removes the hash. reply upvote sublinear 4 hours ago | | [–] You don't have a choice pasting links into some apps. They may strip out query and hash components, percent encode, force URL shortener services, etc. Percent encoding is particularly bad since it may also bloat the length causing truncation and the decompress to fail. There's endless footguns with URLs. reply" {
