  "prompt": "You generate Playwright code to interact with websites.\n - If you want to click a generic button (e.g. that belongs to an element), use the full `.get_by_role()` path to\n   the element (e.g. .get_by_role(\"group\", name=\"Test Item\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\")\n   instead of .get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Go\"), as this is ambiguous)\n - Write exceptionally *correct* Python code.\n - You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge_base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is Search Hacker News for \u201czig x server\u201d (scroll to footer, fill Search, submit).\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled 'All | Search powered by Algolia', with the url 'https://hn.algolia.com/?q=zig+x+server'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nPlan: (1) Scroll to the page footer where the HN search box lives. (2) Locate the Search textbox in the footer, fill it with the query \"zig x server\". (3) Submit the search form (press Enter) and wait for navigation to the search results page. No knowledge_base helper functions are available.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def act(page):\n    # Ensure we're at the footer where the search input is located\n    await page.evaluate(\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)\")\n\n    # Hacker News footer search: label text is typically \"Search:\" next to a textbox\n    search_box = page.get_by_role(\"textbox\")\n    await search_box.wait_for(state=\"visible\")\n    await search_box.fill(\"zig x server\")\n\n    # Submit the search (HN search box submits on Enter)\n    await search_box.press(\"Enter\")\n    await page.wait_for_load_state(\"domcontentloaded\")\n\n</code>\n</previous_actions>\n\nHere is the current website state:\n<webpage_accessibility_tree>\ndocument: \"All | Search powered by Algolia\" {\n  main {\n    link, url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com\";\n    link: \"Search Hacker News\", url: \"/\";\n    searchbox: \"Search stories by title, url or author\";\n    link: \"Algolia Logo\", url: \"https://www.algolia.com/developers/?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=referral\";\n    link, url: \"/settings\";\n    combobox: \"Stories\", expanded: False;\n    combobox: \"Popularity\", expanded: False;\n    combobox: \"All time\", expanded: False;\n    combobox, expanded: False;\n    article {\n      link: \"Phoenix: A modern X server written from scratch in Zig\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"(https://git.dec05eba.com/phoenix/about/)\", url: \"https://git.dec05eba.com/phoenix/about/\";\n      link: \"128 points\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"snvzz\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/user\";\n      link: \"2 hours ago\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"42 comments\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n    };\n\n    article {\n      link: \"Show HN: I built a fast RSS reader in Zig\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"(https://github.com/superstarryeyes/hys)\", url: \"https://github.com/superstarryeyes/hys\";\n      link: \"90 points\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"superstarryeyes\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=superstarryeyes\";\n      link: \"8 days ago\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n      link: \"32 comments\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item\";\n    };\n  };\n};\n\n</webpage_accessibility_tree>\n\nYour previous actions have already executed. So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\n\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n"
