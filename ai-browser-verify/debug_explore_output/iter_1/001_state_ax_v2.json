It quite obvious that open source models are catching up to closed source models very fast they about 3-4 months behind right now, and yeah they are trained on Nvidia chips, but as the open source models become more usable, and closer to closed source models they will eat into Nvidia profit as these companies aren't spending tens of billion dollars on chips to train and run inference. These are smaller models trained on fewer GPUs and they are performing as good as the pervious OpenAI and Anthropic models. So obviously open source models are a direct threat to Nvidia, and they only thing open source models struggle at is scaling inference and this is where Groq and Cerberus come into the picture as they provide the fastest inference for open source models that make them even more usable than SOTA models. Maybe I'm way off on this. reply upvote Workaccount2 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] Shy of an algo breakthrough, open source isn't going to catch up with SOTA, their main trick for model improvement is distilling the SOTA models. That's why they they have perpetually been \"right behind\". reply upvote impulser_ 1 hour ago | | | [\u2013] They don't need to catch up. They just need to be good enough and fast as fuck. Vast majority of useful tasks of LLMs has nothing to do with how smart they are.

Ideally I would have both fast and SOTA; if I would have to pick one I\u2019d go with SOTA. There a report by OpenRouter on what folks tend to pay for it; it generally is SOTA in the coding domain.

Yeah I'm disappointed by this, this is clearly to move them out of the market. Still, that leaves a vacuum for someone else to fill.

Many hundreds of tokens per second of output is the norm, in my experience. I don't recall the prompt processing figures but I think it was somewhere in the low hundreds of tokens per second (so slightly slower than inference). reply upvote ymck 58 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I'd say that it's probably not a play against open source, but more trying to remove/change the bottlenecks in the current chip production cycle. Nvidia likely doesn't care who wins, they just want to sell their chips. They literally can't make enough to meet current demand. If they split off the inference business (and now own one of the only purchasable alternatives) they can spin up more production. That said, it's completely anti-competitive. Nvidia could design a inference chip themselves, but instead the are locking down one of the only real independents. But... Nobody was saying Groq was making any real money. This might just be a rescue mission. reply upvote SkyPuncher 1 hour ago | | | [\u2013] They need to vertically integrate the entire stack or they die. All of the big players are already making plans for their own chips/hardware.

The are not \"spending $20 billion to handicap Groq\". They are handing Groq $20 billion to do whatever they want with it. Groq can take this money and build more chips, do more R&D, hire more people. $20 billion is truly a lot of money. It's quite hard to \"handicap\" someone by giving them $20 billion. reply upvote wmf 19 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] Groq doesn't have any employees. They can't do R&D because there's no one to do it.

Two ways to think about it: weight vs volume. By weight (assuming all $100 bills): $20,000,000,000 / $100 = 200,000,000 bills Each bill is roughly 1g, so total mass is ~200,000 kg A typical builder\u2019s wheelbarrow can take about 100 kg before it becomes unmanageable 200,000 kg total / 100 kg per wheelbarrow \u2248 2,000 wheelbarrows (weight limit) By volume: A $100 bill is ~6.14\" \u00d7 2.61\" \u00d7 0.11 mm, which comes out to about 102 cm\u00b3 per bill 200,000,000 bills \u00d7 102 cm\u00b3 \u2248 20,400 m\u00b3 of cash A standard wheelbarrow holds around 0.08 m\u00b3 (80 litres) 20,400 m\u00b3 total / 0.08 m\u00b3 per wheelbarrow \u2248 255,000 wheelbarrows (volume limit) So, About 2,000 wheelbarrows if you only care about weight About 255,000 wheelbarrows if you actually have to fit the cash in So the limiting factor isn\u2019t how heavy the money is; it\u2019s that the physical volume of the cash is absurd. At this scale, $20bn in $100s is effectively a warehouse, not a stack. reply upvote ThrowawayTestr 53 minutes ago | | [\u2013] Your volume of a single bill is a bit off. reply upvote yousif_123123 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] Not good.

That's twice the price to revenue multiplier applied to Anthropic in their most recent funding round, and really really hard to portray as a good deal.

Grow recent investors got back a 3x multiple and may now invest in one of Nvidia's other competitors instead. reply upvote bri3d 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] The only thing I can think of here is that OpenAI\u2019s DRAM land grab is going to stack on a non-NV target and NV need to hedge with an SRAM design that\u2019s on the market NOW. Otherwise, I can\u2019t see how NV couldn\u2019t eat Groq\u2019s lunch in one development cycle - it\u2019s not like NV can\u2019t attach a TPU to some SRAM and an interconnect. Either that or Groq closed a deep enough book to scare them, but 40x is a lot of scared. reply upvote fancyfredbot 50 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] That's an interesting take, it's plausible Nvidia wants to have an SRAM based product, but I am struggling to see why they would pay $20bn to have one /right now/. Even if DRAM prices make Groq's approach more economical, Nvidia can develop a competitive product before Groq could take any real market share. reply upvote bri3d 49 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] Exactly. The only way this makes sense to me is if the board needed this product in <1 cycle. Which makes no sense for a market player like NV who already have the PDK, volume, and literally everything else in the universe. But here it is, so there is clearly a factor I have not considered :) reply upvote Imustaskforhelp 43 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] But if all of these large companies create a monopoly where they realize that if they start undercutting each other or innovating too extremely then long term if Nvidia's stock decreases in value by a huge margin, the whole market itself can get down As an example: if google TPU (perfected?) itself to the point that it hurts nvidia sales (maybe mass production perhaps?) then all the companies stock price might decrease (in my opinion including google) Honestly, I feel like there is going to happen something in the market which is gonna be very spooky soon regarding AI.

One of the biggest threats to Nvidia is people developing AI-centric ASICs before they get there. Yes, Google has their TPUs and there are others around, but it's early on. In some ways, it's not about eliminating a competitor. It's about eliminating all the competitors. Nvidia can use its resources to push AI ASICs farther faster than others, potentially cutting off a whole host of competitors that threaten their business. Nvidia has the hardware and software talent, the money, and the market position to give their AI ASICs an advantage. They know if they don't lean into ASICs that someone else will and their gravy train will end. So they almost certainly won't be abandoning the technology.

So I came to the conclusion that unless I could convince the client to set up an enterprise contract or something, we could not use either provider for low-latency, which we need for voice calls.

Reciprocally, perhaps kind of cool to see Groq get a massive funding boost and help from a very experienced chip making peer. It feels like an envious position somewhat, even with the long term consequences being so hazy. From the outside yes it looks like Nvidia solidifying their iron grasp over a market with very limited competitive suppliers, but this could help Groq, and maybe it's not on the terms we think we want right now, but could be very cool to see. I really hope some of the rest of the markets can see what's happening, broadly, with Nvidia forming partnerships all over the place. NVLink with Intel, NVLink with Amazon's Tritanium... there's much more to the ecosystem, but just connecting the chips smartly is a huge task, is core to inter-operation. And for all we've heard of CXL, UltraAccelerator Link (UALink) and UltraEthernet (UET) it feels like very few major players are taking it seriously enough to just integrate these new interconnects & make them awesome. They remain incredible expensive & not commonly used, lacking broad industry adoption, and reserved for very expensive systems: there's a huge existential risk here that (lack of) interconnect will destroy competitors ability to get their good chips well integrated and used. The rest of the market needs more clear alarm bells going off, and needs to be making sure good interconnect is available on way more chips, get it into everyone's hands ASAP not just big customers, so that adoption & Linux nerd type folks can start building stacks that open up the future.

Similar to Intel in both the pre-Core days and their more recent chips, they need an actual new architecture to move forward. As sits, there\u2019s no path to profitability for the buyers of these chips given the cost and capabilities of the current LLM architectures, and this is obvious enough that even Nvidia has to realize it\u2019s existential for them. If Groq\u2019s architecture can actually change the economics of inference and training sufficient to bring the costs in line with the actual, not speculative, benefits of LLMs, this may not be a buy-and-kill for Nvidia but something closer to Apple\u2019s acquisition of P.A. Semi, which made the A- and M- class chips possible.

It quite obvious that open source models are catching up to closed source models very fast they about 3-4 months behind right now, and yeah they are trained on Nvidia chips, but as the open source models become more usable, and closer to closed source models they will eat into Nvidia profit as these companies aren't spending tens of billion dollars on chips to train and run inference. These are smaller models trained on fewer GPUs and they are performing as good as the pervious OpenAI and Anthropic models. So obviously open source models are a direct threat to Nvidia, and they only thing open source models struggle at is scaling inference and this is where Groq and Cerberus come into the picture as they provide the fastest inference for open source models that make them even more usable than SOTA models.

Nvidia likely doesn't care who wins, they just want to sell their chips. They literally can't make enough to meet current demand. If they split off the inference business (and now own one of the only purchasable alternatives) they can spin up more production. That said, it's completely anti-competitive.

The problem with this approach imo is that long term, nvidia's stock is extremely overvalued and its still a bubble which will burst and it will take nvidia first and foremost. The issue is that when nvidia falls, it will take the whole literal industry from top to bottom, even those companies which I thought could survive an AI burst. Long term I feel like it will have really bad impacts if nvidia continues to gobble up every company. I am pretty sure that Nvidia might be looking at cerebras too and if they offer them a shit ton of money and cerebras gets bought. I genuinely believe that Nvidia has sort of invested in literally all pockets of any hardware related investment for AI. And when OpenAI is unable to pay Nvidia, I feel like it can all come crashing down since this whole cycle is only being possible via external investor money. reply upvote kreyenborgi 3 hours ago | | [\u2013] There was an AMA here last year https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39429047 reply upvote nntwozz 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] I remember when Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion in stock.

One of the biggest threats to Nvidia is people developing AI-centric ASICs before they get there. Yes, Google has their TPUs and there are others around, but it's early on. In some ways, it's not about eliminating a competitor. It's about eliminating all the competitors. Nvidia can use its resources to push AI ASICs farther faster than others, potentially cutting off a whole host of competitors that threaten their business. Nvidia has the hardware and software talent, the money, and the market position to give their AI ASICs an advantage. They know if they don't lean into ASICs that someone else will and their gravy train will end. So they almost certainly won't be abandoning the technology.

It was really disappointing too because Cerebras does not provide any service reliability on their cheap plans. So I came to the conclusion that unless I could convince the client to set up an enterprise contract or something, we could not use either provider for low-latency, which we need for voice calls. I think for organizations that can afford a hefty contract that guarantees service levels, Groq and Cerebras especially are basically cheat codes for meeting latency requirements for voice.

Full CUDA feels maybe doubtful but who knows. Nvidia CUDA Tile feels like more of a maybe, their new much more explicit way of making workloads. This does feel a bit sad for sure, worrying whether this might hold Groq and innovation back. Reciprocally, perhaps kind of cool to see Groq get a massive funding boost and help from a very experienced chip making peer. It feels like an envious position somewhat, even with the long term consequences being so hazy. From the outside yes it looks like Nvidia solidifying their iron grasp over a market with very limited competitive suppliers, but this could help Groq, and maybe it's not on the terms we think we want right now, but could be very cool to see. I really hope some of the rest of the markets can see what's happening, broadly, with Nvidia forming partnerships all over the place. NVLink with Intel, NVLink with Amazon's Tritanium... there's much more to the ecosystem, but just connecting the chips smartly is a huge task, is core to inter-operation. And for all we've heard of CXL, UltraAccelerator Link (UALink) and UltraEthernet (UET) it feels like very few major players are taking it seriously enough to just integrate these new interconnects & make them awesome. They remain incredible expensive & not commonly used, lacking broad industry adoption, and reserved for very expensive systems: there's a huge existential risk here that (lack of) interconnect will destroy competitors ability to get their good chips well integrated and used. The rest of the market needs more clear alarm bells going off, and needs to be making sure good interconnect is available on way more chips, get it into everyone's hands ASAP not just big customers, so that adoption & Linux nerd type folks can start building stacks that open up the future. The market risks getting left behind, if NVLink is built in everywhere and the various other fabrics never become common-place. reply upvote moralestapia 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] \"2.7M Developers and Teams\" So, about ~$1,000/each?

Similar to Intel in both the pre-Core days and their more recent chips, they need an actual new architecture to move forward. As sits, there\u2019s no path to profitability for the buyers of these chips given the cost and capabilities of the current LLM architectures, and this is obvious enough that even Nvidia has to realize it\u2019s existential for them. If Groq\u2019s architecture can actually change the economics of inference and training sufficient to bring the costs in line with the actual, not speculative, benefits of LLMs, this may not be a buy-and-kill for Nvidia but something closer to Apple\u2019s acquisition of P.A. Semi, which made the A- and M- class chips possible. (Mind you, in Intel\u2019s case they had to have their clocks cleaned by AMD a couple times to get them to see, but I think we\u2019re further past the point of diminishing returns with Nvidia - I think they\u2019re far enough past when the economics turned against them that Reality is their competition now.) reply upvote jvanderbot 2 hours ago | | [\u2013] NVIDIA and \"no path to profitability\" don't belong in the same zip code. reply upvote jonah 2 hours ago | | | [\u2013] I read it as path to profitability for the AI companies buying Nvidia's chips. reply upvote roughly 2 hours ago | | | | [\u2013] No path to profitability for the people using their products for their putative purpose, which seems like it might affect Nvidia\u2019s bottom line at some point.

It quite obvious that open source models are catching up to closed source models very fast they about 3-4 months behind right now, and yeah they are trained on Nvidia chips, but as the open source models become more usable, and closer to closed source models they will eat into Nvidia profit as these companies aren't spending tens of billion dollars on chips to train and run inference. These are smaller models trained on fewer GPUs and they are performing as good as the pervious OpenAI and Anthropic models. So obviously open source models are a direct threat to Nvidia, and they only thing open source models struggle at is scaling inference and this is where Groq and Cerberus come into the picture as they provide the fastest inference for open source models that make them even more usable than SOTA models. Maybe I'm way off on this. reply upvote Workaccount2 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] Shy of an algo breakthrough, open source isn't going to catch up with SOTA, their main trick for model improvement is distilling the SOTA models.

Many hundreds of tokens per second of output is the norm, in my experience. I don't recall the prompt processing figures but I think it was somewhere in the low hundreds of tokens per second (so slightly slower than inference). reply upvote ymck 58 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] I'd say that it's probably not a play against open source, but more trying to remove/change the bottlenecks in the current chip production cycle. Nvidia likely doesn't care who wins, they just want to sell their chips. They literally can't make enough to meet current demand. If they split off the inference business (and now own one of the only purchasable alternatives) they can spin up more production. That said, it's completely anti-competitive. Nvidia could design a inference chip themselves, but instead the are locking down one of the only real independents. But... Nobody was saying Groq was making any real money. This might just be a rescue mission. reply upvote SkyPuncher 1 hour ago | | | [\u2013] They need to vertically integrate the entire stack or they die.

Two ways to think about it: weight vs volume. By weight (assuming all $100 bills): $20,000,000,000 / $100 = 200,000,000 bills Each bill is roughly 1g, so total mass is ~200,000 kg A typical builder\u2019s wheelbarrow can take about 100 kg before it becomes unmanageable 200,000 kg total / 100 kg per wheelbarrow \u2248 2,000 wheelbarrows (weight limit) By volume: A $100 bill is ~6.14\" \u00d7 2.61\" \u00d7 0.11 mm, which comes out to about 102 cm\u00b3 per bill 200,000,000 bills \u00d7 102 cm\u00b3 \u2248 20,400 m\u00b3 of cash A standard wheelbarrow holds around 0.08 m\u00b3 (80 litres) 20,400 m\u00b3 total / 0.08 m\u00b3 per wheelbarrow \u2248 255,000 wheelbarrows (volume limit) So, About 2,000 wheelbarrows if you only care about weight About 255,000 wheelbarrows if you actually have to fit the cash in So the limiting factor isn\u2019t how heavy the money is; it\u2019s that the physical volume of the cash is absurd.

But here it is, so there is clearly a factor I have not considered :) reply upvote Imustaskforhelp 43 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] But if all of these large companies create a monopoly where they realize that if they start undercutting each other or innovating too extremely then long term if Nvidia's stock decreases in value by a huge margin, the whole market itself can get down As an example: if google TPU (perfected?) itself to the point that it hurts nvidia sales (maybe mass production perhaps?) then all the companies stock price might decrease (in my opinion including google) Honestly, I feel like there is going to happen something in the market which is gonna be very spooky soon regarding AI.

One of the biggest threats to Nvidia is people developing AI-centric ASICs before they get there. Yes, Google has their TPUs and there are others around, but it's early on. In some ways, it's not about eliminating a competitor. It's about eliminating all the competitors. Nvidia can use its resources to push AI ASICs farther faster than others, potentially cutting off a whole host of competitors that threaten their business. Nvidia has the hardware and software talent, the money, and the market position to give their AI ASICs an advantage. They know if they don't lean into ASICs that someone else will and their gravy train will end. So they almost certainly won't be abandoning the technology.

NVLink with Intel, NVLink with Amazon's Tritanium... there's much more to the ecosystem, but just connecting the chips smartly is a huge task, is core to inter-operation. And for all we've heard of CXL, UltraAccelerator Link (UALink) and UltraEthernet (UET) it feels like very few major players are taking it seriously enough to just integrate these new interconnects & make them awesome. They remain incredible expensive & not commonly used, lacking broad industry adoption, and reserved for very expensive systems: there's a huge existential risk here that (lack of) interconnect will destroy competitors ability to get their good chips well integrated and used. The rest of the market needs more clear alarm bells going off, and needs to be making sure good interconnect is available on way more chips, get it into everyone's hands ASAP not just big customers, so that adoption & Linux nerd type folks can start building stacks that open up the future.

Two ways to think about it: weight vs volume. By weight (assuming all $100 bills): $20,000,000,000 / $100 = 200,000,000 bills Each bill is roughly 1g, so total mass is ~200,000 kg A typical builder\u2019s wheelbarrow can take about 100 kg before it becomes unmanageable 200,000 kg total / 100 kg per wheelbarrow \u2248 2,000 wheelbarrows (weight limit) By volume: A $100 bill is ~6.14\" \u00d7 2.61\" \u00d7 0.11 mm, which comes out to about 102 cm\u00b3 per bill 200,000,000 bills \u00d7 102 cm\u00b3 \u2248 20,400 m\u00b3 of cash A standard wheelbarrow holds around 0.08 m\u00b3 (80 litres) 20,400 m\u00b3 total / 0.08 m\u00b3 per wheelbarrow \u2248 255,000 wheelbarrows (volume limit) So, About 2,000 wheelbarrows if you only care about weight About 255,000 wheelbarrows if you actually have to fit the cash in So the limiting factor isn\u2019t how heavy the money is; it\u2019s that the physical volume of the cash is absurd.

Nvidia can use its resources to push AI ASICs farther faster than others, potentially cutting off a whole host of competitors that threaten their business. Nvidia has the hardware and software talent, the money, and the market position to give their AI ASICs an advantage.

They could choose to pay the employees some portion of the funds. If not, the owners are likely liable to be sued for \"selling in effect\" without paying equity holders. Presuming the company becomes a defacto subsidiary of Nvidia (even if not legally so) My guess, without researching it, is they will compensate existing equity holders to avoid that possibility. I mean the valuation multiple is enormous, it's worth it simply to derisk the legal aspect. reply upvote wmf 43 minutes ago | | | | [\u2013] For vested RSUs it's likely that the Groq husk will pay out the $20B as a dividend or buyback or something. I don't know if unvested RSUs are accelerated or just canceled. Of course the employees will receive new RSUs when they join Nvidia. reply upvote lotsofpulp 46 minutes ago | | | [\u2013] Unless one is worried about the government, no one ever means paper money. reply upvote diogenescynic 2 hours ago | | | [\u2013] It's the latter.

While the acquisition includes all of Groq\u2019s assets, its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction, said Davis. Wait, what? How is the cloud business supposed to run if Nvidia is acquiring the rights to the hardware? reply upvote onion2k 3 hours ago | | [\u2013] It isn't, and the other companies that offer cloud AI that Nvidia has invested in can carry on happy they have one less competitor. This is how business works in the 21st century - once one company has a dominant position and a massive warchest they can just buy any business that has any potential of disrupting their revenue. It's literally the thesis Peter Thiel sets out in Zero To One. It works really well for that one business. reply upvote ChristianJacobs 3 hours ago | | | [\u2013] That's the neat trick - it isn't... reply upvote garyfirestorm 3 hours ago | | | [\u2013] Sell the asset and then lease it from the buyer. reply upvote throwup238 3 hours ago | | | [\u2013] That works fine with office buildings and stuff where a company is redistributing its risk profile, but not when the company it\u2019s selling to has every incentive to kill the asset as a competitor. reply upvote fancyfredbot 2 hours ago | | | [\u2013] From the press release, Nvidia now has a non exclusive license to the hardware.

Full CUDA feels maybe doubtful but who knows. Nvidia CUDA Tile feels like more of a maybe, their new much more explicit way of making workloads. This does feel a bit sad for sure, worrying whether this might hold Groq and innovation back. Reciprocally, perhaps kind of cool to see Groq get a massive funding boost and help from a very experienced chip making peer. It feels like an envious position somewhat, even with the long term consequences being so hazy. From the outside yes it looks like Nvidia solidifying their iron grasp over a market with very limited competitive suppliers, but this could help Groq, and maybe it's not on the terms we think we want right now, but could be very cool to see. I really hope some of the rest of the markets can see what's happening, broadly, with Nvidia forming partnerships all over the place. NVLink with Intel, NVLink with Amazon's Tritanium... there's much more to the ecosystem, but just connecting the chips smartly is a huge task, is core to inter-operation. And for all we've heard of CXL, UltraAccelerator Link (UALink) and UltraEthernet (UET) it feels like very few major players are taking it seriously enough to just integrate these new interconnects & make them awesome. They remain incredible expensive & not commonly used, lacking broad industry adoption, and reserved for very expensive systems: there's a huge existential risk here that (lack of) interconnect will destroy competitors ability to get their good chips well integrated and used. The rest of the market needs more clear alarm bells going off, and needs to be making sure good interconnect is available on way more chips, get it into everyone's hands ASAP not just big customers, so that adoption & Linux nerd type folks can start building stacks that open up the future. The market risks getting left behind, if NVLink is built in everywhere and the various other fabrics never become common-place. reply upvote moralestapia 1 hour ago | | [\u2013] \"2.7M Developers and Teams\" So, about ~$1,000/each?

Similar to Intel in both the pre-Core days and their more recent chips, they need an actual new architecture to move forward. As sits, there\u2019s no path to profitability for the buyers of these chips given the cost and capabilities of the current LLM architectures, and this is obvious enough that even Nvidia has to realize it\u2019s existential for them. If Groq\u2019s architecture can actually change the economics of inference and training sufficient to bring the costs in line with the actual, not speculative, benefits of LLMs, this may not be a buy-and-kill for Nvidia but something closer to Apple\u2019s acquisition of P.A. Semi, which made the A- and M- class chips possible. (Mind you, in Intel\u2019s case they had to have their clocks cleaned by AMD a couple times to get them to see, but I think we\u2019re further past the point of diminishing returns with Nvidia - I think they\u2019re far enough past when the economics turned against them that Reality is their competition now.) reply upvote jvanderbot 2 hours ago | | [\u2013] NVIDIA and \"no path to profitability\" don't belong in the same zip code. reply upvote jonah 2 hours ago | | | [\u2013] I read it as path to profitability for the AI companies buying Nvidia's chips. reply upvote roughly 2 hours ago | | | | [\u2013] No path to profitability for the people using their products for their putative purpose, which seems like it might affect Nvidia\u2019s bottom line at some point.
