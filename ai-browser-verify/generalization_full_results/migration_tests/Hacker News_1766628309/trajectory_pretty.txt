<reasoning>
We need to use the Hacker News search feature to search for 'python'. A knowledge_base function exists: hn_search_from_footer(page, query, start_path) that navigates to /news, scrolls to bottom, fills the footer search textbox, presses Enter, and waits for results. This directly matches the required action and is preferred/required when available. We are already on HN front page, but the function will safely start at /news. We'll call it with query='python' and start_path as current listing page URL. After it completes, the task is done (search submitted and results loaded).
</reasoning>

<code>
async def act(page):
    await hn_search_from_footer(page, query="python", start_path="https://news.ycombinator.com/news")
