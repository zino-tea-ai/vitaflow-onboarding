### ✏️ Hack story (可选优化)

**当前内容:**
> I took advantage of the UK university system and got a first class honor degree despite being a total failure in the first 3 years (I repeated my second year). This directly got me into JHU and then the silicon valley

**建议修改为 (更有深度):**
```
I took advantage of the UK university system's final-year weighting and turned a near-failure academic record (repeated second year) into a First Class Honours degree. I reverse-engineered the grading algorithm, identified which modules had the highest impact-to-effort ratio, and executed a focused sprint in my final year. This directly got me into Johns Hopkins CS and then into Silicon Valley—proof that systems thinking beats raw talent.
