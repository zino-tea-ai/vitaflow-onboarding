Drone inspections identify maintenance concerns before they cause faults. Faults cause power outages, and spark wildfires - like the Eaton Fire in early 2025 where 19 people lost their lives and nearly 10,000 structures were destroyed. Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost.\r\n\r\nSince June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.\r\n\r\nAfter power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets.

We cut inspection time from about 5 minutes to under 30 seconds per fish, with more than 90 percent accuracy, so farms advance only high quality fish and waste less feed and labor. Our goal is to bring automation across the entire fish production lifecycle for the $300B aquaculture industry.\r\n\r\nAquaculture is the fastest growing food sector, and has already surpassed commercial fishing for production of seafood. Yet two of the most critical QA and QC steps in fish production are still done by hand: phenotyping and deformity inspection. These processes are slow, error prone, and despised by technicians but vital for the success of the farm, so much so that farms spend >$200K a year on trained technicians and geneticists to operate. We’ve built an AI vision platform for vertically integrated finfish farms that drops into existing workflows starting in the hatchery, uses off the shelf cameras, standardizes these QA steps, and creates a proprietary multi species dataset that becomes the brain for future autonomous aquafarms. Phenotyping is the start, but the platform is designed to be a drop in solution that can easily expand into feeding, health monitoring, and processing so we can solve production problems across the lifecycle.\r\n\r\n We signed a 6-figure paid pilot with the largest trout producer in the United States, are deploying into 2 more farms early 2026, and trained models above 90 percent accuracy while cutting inspection time from 5 minutes to under 30 seconds. Each deployment adds labeled images to our dataset and improves cross species generalization.\r\n",

    "long_description": "Private markets are still opaque, manual, and locked inside Excel. Every year, trillions of dollars in venture, real-estate, and private-equity capital are deployed through diligence processes that haven’t changed in decades. Analysts spend hours parsing PDFs and spreadsheets just to understand what a company or property is worth.\r\n\r\nAlt-X is building the data and AI infrastructure layer for alternative assets — a system that ingests unstructured deal materials, normalizes the data, and generates institutional-grade analysis in seconds. Whether it’s a private-company dataroom or a real-estate offering memorandum, Alt-X extracts key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, and cap rate, then produces investor-ready dashboards and reports automatically.\r\n\r\nOur platform reduces deal evaluation timelines by up to 73%, saves 30–50 analyst hours per deal, and enables teams to screen 4× more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating KPI extraction, benchmarking, and underwriting, Alt-X transforms diligence from a manual bottleneck into a scalable process.\r\n\r\nThis hasn’t been done at scale because private-market data is fragmented across formats and asset classes. Alt-X’s parsing engine unifies this chaos into a structured schema — the backbone for cross-asset underwriting, KPI dashboards, and automated risk scoring.\r\n\r\nOur first wedge is real estate and private equity, where underwriting is slowest and most manual. We’re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200 million in assets, paying $1K–$5K per month to automate deal screening and valuation.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: over $1.4 trillion in new private-equity and real-estate deals are underwritten globally each year, with $25–30 billion spent on diligence and analytics. Yet over 90% of this still happens manually. Alt-X’s mission is to become the operating system for private-market investing — the Bloomberg Terminal of the AI era.",

We launched four weeks ago. Over 1,200 people have downloaded Iris, 168 use it every day, and they’ve taken more than 36,000 actions so far growing 48% week over week.\r\n\r\nIn the future, everyone will have a personal proxy running their digital life with near perfect accuracy.

We understand meaning in text, documents, and databases to detect sensitive information based on your policies, then apply recipient-specific controls without blocking workflows.\r\n\r\nCreate policies in natural language. Teams write rules that define what's sensitive and who should access it, and Velum enforces them consistently across all systems.

For AI workflows, we intercept prompts, responses, and retrievals to prevent sensitive information from leaking into or out of models. For enterprise systems like Salesforce, SAP, or Workday, we extend policy enforcement to exports, reports, and syncs.\r\n\r\nVelum is designed for scale and compliance.

It's a thinking partner that lets you instantly search your entire history of ideas, synthesize them into new insights, and watch your knowledge build on itself over time.\r\n\r\nRight now, your best thinking is trapped in ephemeral AI chat histories. Nessie unifies your context from ChatGPT, Claude, and (soon) Apple Notes/Google Docs/Notion/other context sources, auto-organizing the mess into an AI-enhanced brain.\r\n\r\nNext, we are unlocking sharing. Instead of sending a static doc, you will be able to send your \"Product Strategy Brain\" to a cofounder, or publish your \"Research Brain\" for your entire team to chat with.\r\n\r\nWho it's for: AI-native thinkers—founders, researchers, and writers—who believe their best ideas should compound.\r\n\r\nThe Team: We are two Yale CS grads and former Amazon engineers building the tool we needed for ourselves. We combine Anna's obsession with neuroscience and augmenting human cognition with Tiger's lifelong passion for building products (he shipped an app with 70k+ users at age 13).\r\n\r\nTraction: Launched 3 weeks ago. We have over 1,200 users who have imported 300,000+ AI conversations into Nessie. 30% week-over-week organic user growth.\r\n\r\nOrigin Story: Nessie was born after we hit the 1-million-token limit in multiple Gemini chats. Overnight, months of research disappeared. We realized the problem wasn't just about storage; it was that the medium for AI-native thought didn't exist yet. The chat window is a place to ask questions, not a place to build a mind.\r\n\r\nOur Vision: We are building a new medium for personal intelligence. Everyone will have an AI brain on Nessie. You will use it to think better, remember more, and share your mind with the world.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

In just 3 weeks after launch, over 1000 families across 75 countries have already started creating stories.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting with a clear wedge: personalized kids’ entertainment. Parents are tired of overstimulating, low-value content from YouTube and Netflix. Pixley gives them safe and personalized stories that encourage learning and imagination.\r\n\r\nBut kids’ cartoons are just the beginning. As video generation improves, all video content will shift from manual production to being personalized and generated. Our long-term goal is to build the AI Netflix: a platform where shows and movies aren’t recommended, but instead generated around each viewer’s interests and habits.\r\n\r\nWe’re 19 year old CS dropouts who’ve known each other since elementary school and won 4 hackathons at 15. After seeing AI flood the internet with low-quality content, we created Pixley – a safe, personalized way for kids to turn their ideas into animated stories.",

    "long_description": "Airports are among the most data-rich yet information-poor environments in transportation. Thousands of radio transmissions, aircraft movements, and sensor signals occur every second, but these systems remain siloed. Most airfields still rely on manual logs and calls to understand what’s happening on the ground, creating blind spots that slow coordination and limit safety oversight.\r\n\r\nThe result is a growing safety and efficiency gap. The FAA records four to five runway incursions every day, and over 90% of air traffic control facilities are operating below target staffing levels. Despite $20 billion in modernization programs like NextGen and Safety Management Systems, airports still lack a unified data backbone that connects communication, movement, and intent across the airfield.\r\n\r\nStratus provides the missing layer of intelligence for airport and airside operations — unifying data, communication, and movement into one shared, real-time picture.\r\n\r\nFor airports, this means faster decisions, clearer accountability, and safer, more efficient operations.\r\nFor aviation as a whole, it’s the foundation for connected, data-driven infrastructure that can finally keep pace with modern airside complexity.",

Our system enables voice agents, copilots, and chat interfaces to retrieve, reason, and respond in sub-10 ms, delivering the responsiveness that makes AI interactions feel truly natural.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever built a conversational or voice AI product, you’ve felt the lag. That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding. Moss is already powering production pilots across voice AI and developer platforms, achieving sub-10 ms retrieval and 70–90% token savings compared to traditional pipelines.",

Growers plant without clear demand signals, distributors overbuy to protect against shortages, and retailers end up eating the waste. GETASAP fixes this by rebuilding distribution around real demand and fast execution. We deliver wholesale fresh produce with 8-hour same-day delivery, using micro-fulfillment centers positioned close to demand so we can operate with far less safety stock.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, we look at live retail sales, purchasing, and waste patterns to decide what to source, where to place inventory, and when to replenish. That lets us buy closer to actual demand, turn inventory faster, and materially reduce spoilage. For retailers, GETASAP replaces procurement teams and fragmented supplier management—we handle sourcing, inventory decisions, and fulfillment end to end as a single, reliable partner. As more volume flows through the network, demand becomes clearer, sourcing gets smarter, and the operation becomes cheaper and more predictable over time.",

    "long_description": "Every successful tool is a bet on efficiency. A waterwheel grinds more grain per unit effort than a quern. A transistor switches more operations per watt than a vacuum tube. This is civilization's pattern: do more work with less energy.\r\n\r\nFor ten thousand years, efficiency meant physical work. Intellectual work rode the surplus. Better farming, manufacturing, transport. But the brain itself bottlenecked every intellectual task.\r\n\r\nCompute changes this. For the first time, we can drive efficiency gains in intellectual work directly. Any repeatable job with measurable output has an efficiency ratio. Useful work divided by energy consumed. Intelligence per watt.\r\n\r\nHumans perform tasks at some quality-weighted outcomes per kilowatt-hour. AI systems do the same jobs. We can measure both the same way. AI is crossing the human baseline. Domain after domain.\r\n\r\nThe world's hardest problems are information problems, and human intelligence is no longer the limit. The cost of intelligence per unit of energy is the limit. Every order of magnitude drop in cost expands the set of solvable problems.\r\n\r\nOur mission at Wafer is to maximize intelligence per watt by using AI to optimize AI infrastructure, achieving thousands of times better energy and cost efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe want people to do their life's work here in pursuit of radical abundance. We believe cheap intelligence is the most essential piece of technology for a future of abundance. We will build the future with intelligence \"too cheap to meter.\"",

A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our self-guided missile platform is man-portable and multi-domain capable. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement over existing kinetic solutions. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued their PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nJason and Steve used more than 100 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. In 8 short weeks following a strict 2-week design-build-test cycle, the team has gone through 4 major guided missile iterations with over 30 live-fire flight tests. They were invited to Ft. Hood to present their platform to the 1st Cavalry Division, and also briefed the Pentagon and U.S. congressmen on current U.S. vulnerabilities to advanced drone technology.  Perseus Defense is actively standing up cooperative research agreements with U.S. Army DEVCOM's Applied Research Laboratory, Aviation and Missile Center, Armaments Center, and High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

Our platform integrates directly into existing university systems (SIS, LMS, CRM), learns each institution’s unique workflows, and deploys specialized AI agents. This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.\r\n\r\nSadia previously built Salesforce’s Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.\r\n\r\nDanial was one of DoorDash’s earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale. \r\n\r\nShahryar was a GM at Airwallex, where he built the entire Americas business from 0 to 1 and drove 11x revenue growth.  He’s also a master closer, single-handedly securing over $17M in enterprise deals at NerdWallet.  He’s a relentless startup executor with deep expertise launching and scaling go-to-market machines in highly regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe launched six weeks ago and are already at $8k MRR, growing 55% week-over-week -- one of the fastest ramps ever in higher ed. Universities urgently need solutions that expand labor capacity and efficiency, especially as they face unprecedented budget pressure and staffing shortages.\r\n\r\nWith unmatched buyer access, deep technical expertise, and rapid early traction, we are perfectly positioned to own this enormous market.",

Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution. ",

We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.\r\n\r\n✨ Try building an app at floot.com\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

    "long_description": "𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐰𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬:\r\nI (Angel) have had three knee surgeries since my mid-teens and was billed more than $250K for care that should have cost a fraction of that. Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\r\n\r\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:\r\n• Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n• Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n• Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued. We catch nuanced billing, coding, and contract errors to save 3-7% on annual claims spend. We work with self-insured employers and health plans.\r\n\r\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐔𝐬:\r\nAngel Onuoha (CEO) and Ahmad Shehu (CTO) have worked together for 4 years. Before Avelis Health they built Zuvy, a Lagos-based fintech company that provided invoice factoring to small businesses. Zuvy was acquired by The BAS Group in 2025.",

Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

    "long_description": "Locata is an AI referral management platform for Primary Care. We deploy AI agents to automate every step of the referral process that back-office staff face daily, from submitting prior authorizations to broadcasting updates and following up with patients. This frees up staff to focus on patient care.\r\n\r\nPrimary care back-offices are severely understaffed and overburdened by administrative work associated with referrals. Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",

Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- “Certus changed my life overnight.”\r\n- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”\r\n-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”\r\n- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”\r\n-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

We enable backend devs, designers and product managers to build pretty and functional web apps in a simple and visually guided manner - no matter the used tech stack.\r\n\r\nstagewise lives right inside your browser, makes changes in your local codebase and is compatible with all kinds of frameworks and setups - allowing it to be retrofitted into any existing project. Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built.",

Even the select fleets using algorithms that have fleet-wide context struggle: the outputs are rigid, hard to interpret, and are blind to real-world nuances like driver preferences and schedule exceptions. Fleetline solves this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can easily adapt algorithms to each fleet’s needs and capture driver-specific information. The result is smarter planning truly optimized for every fleet and its drivers.",

As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\r\n- You then jump into the cubic platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and cubic generates diagrams of architecture changes.",

He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\r\n\r\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support — empowering patients to be an active part of their health team.

Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals—before revenue is lost.\r\n\r\nWhile working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes—using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\r\n\r\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla’s former CFO.\r\n\r\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\r\n\r\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows.

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

    "long_description": "Tinfoil makes it easy to make your AI workloads provably private, without changing your code. You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams.

They’re dashboards — not thinking tools.\r\n\r\nSo we built Scalar Field to change that: a platform where users can test any market hypothesis instantly using intelligent agents.\r\n\r\nYou can spin up agents that react to market events, run backtests across data from multiple asset classes, and even trigger trades when specific conditions are met — all in one place.",

Quanstruct is available as a cloud service to start, targeting technical writers, content writing, professional services, and product teams.\r\n\r\nTraditional generative AI tools risk hallucinating critical API & SDK fields, even with RAG based approaches.

In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they’ve been in decades.  \r\n\r\nAs fellows in Stanford’s Center for National Security Innovation, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, we’ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years.

Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

As a Product team at Revolut, we felt this pain deeply ourselves - we had products ready to launch but stuck in compliance limbo, often for weeks. Turns out, getting compliant took as long as building the product itself. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, we dug in and were shocked by how manual and inefficient the processes were. That’s when it clicked: there’s a huge opportunity to automate the boring stuff (and solve our own problem!). Compliance teams win because they ditch the tedious tasks. Product teams win because they ship faster. Everyone’s happy.",

Instead of relying on manual prompt fiddling or guesswork, your agents get a continuous improvement loop: they’re tested, corrected, and optimized based on what your business actually requires—not what a generic model assumes.\r\nThe result is AI agents that reliably follow your domain logic, adapt to changes, and stay aligned across clients, configurations, and environments—without you needing to hand-engineer every prompt or behavior.",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\r\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies.

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",

We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting. We have published the first molecule water solubility results with accuracy within the error range of wet lab experiments. We have also kicked-off a 150K pilot project with a pharma company to apply our tech to estimating solubility in their drug development pipeline.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

Together, we built the first real-time, warehouse-native customer data platform. Prior to that, Dom led 20+ ML engineers at Adobe to build their internal ad optimization platform, which allocates $1B in annual spend. Ben built the microservices stack powering the new Microsoft Edge, scaling from 0 to hundreds of millions of DAUs.\r\n\r\nWe started coding Snowpilot in mid-August '24, and we already have a live app that can run sub-second queries on millions of rows, entirely in the user's browser.\r\n\r\nThe data warehouse market is $10B/yr, growing 23% YOY. We will disrupt incumbents and significantly expand this market by enabling non-engineers to use big data on a daily basis.",

By training massive AI foundation models on protein sequences and structures, we’ve unlocked the ability to generate—on demand—completely novel molecular machines with atomic-level precision. Simply describe the function you need, and our platform imagines the peptide or protein that will deliver it.\r\n\r\nWe're building models to speed up billions of years of evolution into the span of an afternoon's worth of compute.\r\n\r\nThe result? New-to-nature therapies, ultra-efficient catalysts for sustainable manufacturing, and a whole new frontier of molecular innovation—designed as precisely as any cutting-edge aircraft or microchip.",

    "long_description": "Historically, quantitative models are domain specific. Brilliant people spend their best years testing features, tuning hyperparameters, and iterating architectures within a narrow domain. But scale is the panacea: large models will find patterns people, and specialized models, could not. \r\n\r\nForecasting generalizes. Zoa trains cross-domain event forecasting engines. \r\n\r\n*Automating Iteration*\r\n\r\nLLMs—embedded in multi-agent optimization loops and evaluated against fixed policies—can automate the build-test-improve modeling cycle. Think AlphaEvolve for forecasting problems.\r\n\r\n*Sample-Efficient General Models*\r\n\r\nToday’s forecasting models are narrowly crafted with deep human priors. But larger models will outperform state-of-the-art specialized models.\r\n\r\nUnlike existing event models, our models leverage data from across contexts and rely less on human intuition. And compared to LLMs, our models are built with more inductive priors and rely more heavily on inference-time compute—improving sample efficiency.\r\n\r\n*Why It Matters*\r\n\r\nIn the real economy, our models could be useful for forecasting supply chain volatility, energy supply and demand, even earthquake risk.\r\n\r\nScience is, Ian Hacking writes, the taming of chance. It is the process of iteratively updating priors (something like: identify uncertainty, conceive experiment to reduce uncertainty, execute, update). If science is uncertainty-reduction, forecasting is a critical measure of progress. \r\n\r\nBetter forecasting improves our ability to select interesting experiments (roughly those with greatest expected uncertainty reduction) and update priors. Our models will be used by labs and academics in data-heavy domains. \r\n\r\nSam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at Carnegie Mellon in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has. After college, Greg went to Harvard Law School, while Sam worked for three years at Jane Street on their Options desk, building & leading a satellite dev team.",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.\r\n\r\nWhile a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. \r\n\r\nTo change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.\r\n\r\nWe’re world class microbial engineers. We met while doing our PhDs in synthetic biology, where we spent our time applying and developing the most advanced bioengineering technologies to engineer living cells. ",

    "long_description": "The rise of low-cost commercial drones has introduced a new class of asymmetric threats to U.S. national security. Off-the-shelf platforms now deliver ISR, contraband, or payloads with precision, while operating below radar coverage and beyond line-of-sight. These systems—often costing under $1,000—are capable of neutralizing multi-million-dollar defense assets. For drone detection to be viable at scale, sensors must achieve cost parity with the threat.\r\n\r\nIn response, the Department of Defense established multiple initiatives to counter the rapid proliferation of uncrewed aerial systems. The Joint Counter-small UAS Office (JCO) coordinates policy and acquisition across services. The Base Defense Cross-Functional Team enables persistent perimeter security for CONUS and OCONUS installations. Falcon Peak, Red Sands, and related exercises are accelerating deployment of counter-UAS technologies in complex environments.\r\n\r\nThis threat is no longer exclusive to military operations overseas. It now directly targets the U.S. homeland. In 2025, an executive order designated the protection of American airspace sovereignty a national priority, recognizing that uncrewed systems present both surveillance and kinetic risks within the United States. That same year, a domestic extremist plotted to destroy a Tennessee power substation using a drone rigged with C-4 explosives—a plan disrupted by undercover federal agents. In July 2025, an unauthorized drone collided with a rescue helicopter during disaster response operations in Kerr County, Texas, forcing an emergency landing and halting flood relief efforts. These are not isolated incidents—they reflect a broader shift in drone-enabled threats against homeland infrastructure and public safety.\r\n\r\nGuardian RF builds passive, radiofrequency-based drone detection systems for force protection and critical infrastructure defense inside the United States. Our systems are fielded under an AFWERX Direct-to-Phase-II SBIR with the 30th Security Forces Squadron at Vandenberg Space Force Base, deployed by local and state law enforcement, and integrated into commercial security operations. We were selected as a finalist for Falcon Peak 25.2, the Department of Defense’s premier counter-UAS exercise.\r\n\r\nScout is a passive RF sensor for fixed, mobile, or temporary deployments. It detects and classifies drone control signals—including modified variants of DJI, Crossfire, and ExpressLRS—at standoff ranges. Scout supports direct integration into TAK and other operational APIs and is managed through GRF-SECURE, our secure interface for live monitoring, threat alerting, and forensic review.\r\n\r\nMosaic extends coverage in austere environments, enabling persistent low-altitude monitoring and classification of non–Remote ID drones across complex terrain—without active emissions or mesh dependency.\r\n\r\nBuilt in the United States, Guardian RF delivers scalable, automated, and cost-aligned drone detection—passive by design and hardened for real-world deployment across the homeland.",

At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance—all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had—an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",

From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",

Every year 50% of U.S. truck space goes unused, a $100B+ inefficiency. Oway uses AI to automatically price, match, and sell that space in real time, giving businesses freight shipping that is dramatically faster and cheaper than traditional options. \r\n\r\nWe're building the largest decentralized network of America’s empty truck space - a transparent infrastructure layer any shipper, broker, or carrier can plug into. For shippers, this means freight costs that are up to 50% lower than traditional LTL (shipments from 1 to 12 pallets), along with faster delivery windows because freight moves directly from dock to dock without the slow handoffs, warehouses, or cross-docking infrastructure that LTL depends on. For carriers, Oway’s integration can increase annual revenues by up to 30% with minimal impact on existing schedules. They simply earn more by monetizing space that would have gone unused.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to transform empty truck space into an asset that strengthens U.S. competitiveness. By lowering the cost of goods sold, we help businesses grow. By improving carrier margins, we make trucking more sustainable. And by digitizing and decentralizing freight, we are laying the foundation for a resilient, transparent logistics layer that can support America’s reindustrialization in the decades ahead. Oway makes freight shipping as simple as ridesharing - click a button, book a truck, and move goods at the true cost of available capacity.",

For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.\r\n\r\nBy selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. \r\n\r\nThousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned. \r\n",

They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\r\n• Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\r\n• Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\r\n• All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\r\n• Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\r\n• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\r\n• And more...\r\n\r\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM—traditionally scattered across multiple systems—into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Users who deepen bonds with these AI character friends can invite them out with them to Discord, Minecraft or even a Netflix-n-chill session.\r\n\r\nOur Character engine, ego AI, built on top of Unreal, will allow users to create, deploy and even monetize their characters across any surface that supports our CCProtocol. The first use case for our characters will likely be DnD-style roleplay, Minecraft RP, and Twitch streaming. \r\n\r\nCharacters will always live and exist in Simtowns with other AIs (and humans) where they will all lead varied internal lives replete with conflict, danger, opportunity, and love…just like humans in the real world!\r\n\r\nDuring YC, we used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld).

Aidy excels at identifying patterns between diet, treatment adherence, and symptoms, giving our users a much more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of their condition to supplement clinician care. \r\n\r\nPreviously in our careers, both Max and Peter worked in health in different capacities. At the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Senate, Max worked in public health policy and COVID-19 response, while Peter worked as an ML researcher for a number of biotech companies. After a lengthy “pivot hell” we decided to finally listen to a friend with IBD who insisted that there weren’t any decent apps to help people live with the disease. Pretty quickly, we discovered how LLMs and regular structured questionnaire responses could provide a level of patient empowerment not possible before for chronic diseases.

We then started experimenting with ML to speed up the process.\r\n\r\nNow, as a team of three friends from the University of Cambridge, we’ve spent the last month combining our domain expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Chemistry to develop state of the art models for reaction optimisation.\r\n\r\nAlthough ML is becoming well established in other fields, current chemical models generalise poorly and require lots of programming experience. We make our models easily accessible to chemists in the lab.\r\n\r\nFinding the right conditions quickly allows pharmaceutical companies to test more drugs, and finding better optima makes manufacturing process cheaper and more environmentally friendly.",

Moreover, these data files and reports cannot be easily reused due to poor data infrastructure. \r\n\r\nPowered by AI, our product cuts hours of data wrangling work down to minutes and makes it possible to query past data easily. This helps firms evaluate assets faster and win more deals.\r\n\r\nSince launching last month, we've started a pilot with a brokerage team at a public investment bank that now uses our product daily. Aiming to serve over 100,000 investment teams needing complex data analysis for alternative investments, this opens up a potential $5 billion market.",

CommodityAI acts as a digital operator, continuously reading, interpreting, and updating information across the trade lifecycle to keep records accurate and systems in sync.\r\n\r\nOur agents extract and validate key details from trade confirmations, contracts, vessel updates, and more — turning scattered, unstructured data into clean, structured records that flow directly into CTRMs, ERPs, and other core platforms. No manual entry required.\r\n\r\nBy automating what others still do by hand, we help trading teams move faster, reduce risk, and focus on the decisions that matter most.",

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",
